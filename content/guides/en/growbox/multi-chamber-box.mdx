# Multi-Chamber Growbox: NGB Model

![Multi-chamber growbox](/images/guides/multi-chamber-box.jpg)

## The NGB Concept

NGB (New Grow Box) is an approach to growbox design with **multiple isolated chambers** inside a single enclosure. Instead of one shared space, the box is divided into functional zones, each with its own microclimate, lighting, and ventilation.

The core idea: run a **continuous growing cycle**. While one plant flowers in the flowering chamber, the next grows in the vegetation chamber, and the harvest dries in the drying chamber. Harvest every 4–6 weeks instead of 3–4 months.

## Advantages

- **Continuous cycle** — no downtime between harvests
- **Optimal conditions** — each chamber has its own light schedule, temperature, humidity
- **Compact** — everything in one enclosure
- **Light isolation** — flowering chamber protected from stray light
- **Unified ventilation** — one carbon filter for the entire box

## Chamber Design

### Vegetation Chamber (Upper)
- **Dimensions:** 60 × 60 × 40 cm
- **Lighting:** LED 6500K, 50–100 W, 18/6

### Flowering Chamber (Main)
- **Dimensions:** 60 × 60 × 100 cm
- **Lighting:** full spectrum LED, 150–300 W, 12/12

### Drying Chamber (Side)
- **Dimensions:** 30 × 60 × 40 cm
- **Lighting:** none (complete darkness)
- **Humidity:** 55–65%

## Inter-Chamber Isolation

Even minimal light leakage from veg to flower chamber can stress plants.

- Dividers from 10 mm plywood or PVC, lined with reflective material
- All joints sealed with black silicone or light-proof tape
- Doors with double sealing (magnetic strip + foam gasket)
- Wire passages through cable glands

## Separate Ventilation

| Chamber | Intake | Exhaust | Carbon Filter |
|---------|--------|---------|---------------|
| Vegetation | 100 mm fan | Into shared duct | Not required |
| Flowering | 125 mm fan | Main exhaust 125 mm | Required |
| Drying | Passive | 80 mm fan, low speed | Recommended |

## Light Traps

Labyrinth channels where air passes but light cannot. Install on all ventilation transitions between chambers. Simple: 125 mm duct with 2–3 staggered black baffles, or S-shaped flexible aluminum duct.

## Overall Dimensions: 90 × 60 × 160 cm
