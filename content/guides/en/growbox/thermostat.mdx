# Thermostat for Your Growbox

![Growbox thermostat](/images/guides/thermostat.jpg)

A thermostat automatically turns heating and cooling equipment on or off to maintain a set temperature. Essential for stable growbox climate.

## Why You Need One

- Activates exhaust fan or AC when overheating
- Activates heater during cold periods
- Maintains stable temperature without intervention
- Protects against emergency overheating

## Types

### Mechanical
Simple bimetallic devices. Cheap, low accuracy (±2–3°C), no display.

### Digital
Electronic with display, precise sensor, hysteresis adjustment. Accuracy ±0.5–1°C. Optimal choice.

### Wi-Fi
Remote monitoring and control via app. Convenient but pricier.

## Popular Models

| Model | Type | Accuracy | Relay | Price |
|-------|------|----------|-------|-------|
| STC-1000 | Digital | ±0.5°C | 10A (heat + cool) | $5–10 |
| Inkbird ITC-308 | Digital | ±1°C | 10A (2 outlets) | $20–30 |
| Inkbird ITC-308 Wi-Fi | Wi-Fi | ±1°C | 10A (2 outlets) | $30–40 |
| W3230 | Digital | ±0.5°C | 20A | $4–7 |
| Sonoff TH16 | Wi-Fi | ±1°C | 16A | $12–18 |

**Recommendation:** Inkbird ITC-308 — two outlets (heating + cooling), simple setup.

## Connecting STC-1000

- **Terminals 1, 2** — 220V power
- **Terminals 3, 4** — cooling output (fan)
- **Terminals 5, 6** — heating output (heater)
- **Terminals 7, 8** — NTC temperature sensor

Place sensor inside box at canopy level, away from lamp. Max load: 10A.

## What Is Hysteresis

Difference between on and off temperatures. Example: cooling setpoint 28°C, hysteresis 2°C:
- Fan **on** at 28°C, **off** at 26°C

Recommended: **1–2°C**.

## Optimal Temperatures

| Stage | Day | Night | Difference |
|-------|-----|-------|-----------|
| Germination | 24–26°C | 22–24°C | 2–4°C |
| Seedling | 22–25°C | 18–22°C | 3–5°C |
| Vegetation | 24–28°C | 18–22°C | 4–6°C |
| Flowering | 22–26°C | 17–20°C | 5–8°C |
| Ripening | 20–24°C | 15–18°C | 5–8°C |

## Tips

- Place sensor in shade, at canopy level
- Don't let sensor contact wet surfaces
- Verify with second thermometer periodically
- HPS lamps: cooling thermostat mandatory
- LED lighting: heating thermostat often needed for winter nights
