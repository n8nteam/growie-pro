# AquaFarm System: Hydroponics for Beginners

![AquaFarm DWC system](/images/guides/aquafarm-system.jpg)

## What Is AquaFarm

AquaFarm is a ready-made hydroponic system combining two growing methods: **DWC (Deep Water Culture)** and **drip irrigation**. Manufactured by General Hydroponics. Ideal for beginners who want to try hydroponics without complex DIY assembly.

The principle is simple: the plant sits in a pot with clay pebbles, roots are submerged in aerated nutrient solution, and a pump delivers solution from above through a drip ring.

## How It Works

1. **DWC component** — roots submerged in a reservoir with nutrient solution, constantly aerated by an air pump through an air stone.
2. **Drip irrigation** — a pump draws solution from the reservoir and delivers it through tubing to a drip ring around the stem.

This combination ensures maximum root oxygenation and even nutrient distribution.

## AquaFarm Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| 30 L reservoir | Main solution tank |
| Net pot | Inserts into the reservoir lid |
| Air pump | Solution aeration |
| Air stone | Air diffusion in solution |
| Drip ring | Even solution delivery from above |
| Water pump | Lifts solution to drip ring |
| Tubing and fittings | Connection elements |
| Level indicator | Solution level monitoring |

Additionally needed: clay pebbles (~10 L), Flora series nutrients (Micro, Grow, Bloom), pH meter, and TDS meter.

## Solution Parameters

### pH

- **Vegetation:** pH 5.5–6.0
- **Flowering:** pH 5.8–6.2
- **Acceptable fluctuations:** ±0.3 within 24 hours

### EC (Electrical Conductivity)

- **Seedlings / clones:** EC 0.4–0.8
- **Early vegetation:** EC 0.8–1.2
- **Active vegetation:** EC 1.2–1.6
- **Flowering:** EC 1.4–2.0
- **Ripening:** EC 0.8–1.0

## Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Rinse clay pebbles** — soak 24 hours in pH 5.5 water, then rinse thoroughly.
2. **Assemble the system** — connect pump, air stone, drip ring per instructions.
3. **Fill the reservoir** — filtered or RO water (EC < 0.1).
4. **Prepare solution** — add nutrients at 50% dosage.
5. **Calibrate pH** — adjust to 5.8.
6. **Plant** — place sprouted seedling in clay pebbles.
7. **Start the system** — turn on compressor and pump.

## Maintenance

- **Daily:** check pH and EC, top up water.
- **Every 3–5 days:** adjust solution, add nutrients.
- **Every 7–10 days:** complete solution change.
- **Monthly:** clean air stone in hydrogen peroxide, clean pump.
- **Monitor solution temperature:** optimal 18–22°C.

## Pros and Cons

### Advantages

- Faster growth compared to soil (30–50%)
- Ready-made solution — no construction needed
- Dual feeding system (DWC + drip)
- Compact size for a single plant

### Disadvantages

- Designed for one plant
- Requires daily pH and EC monitoring
- Compressor noise
- Risk of drip ring clogging
- Electricity dependent — pump failure is critical

## Expert Tips

- Use an **air compressor with extra capacity** — more aeration is better than less.
- Wrap the reservoir in **reflective material** — light must not enter the solution.
- Keep a **spare air stone** — they clog over time.
- Start with **half-strength** nutrients.
- Add **Hydroguard or similar** — beneficial bacteria protect roots from pathogens.
