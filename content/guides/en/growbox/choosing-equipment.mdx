# How to Choose Growing Equipment

![Growing Equipment](/images/guides/equipment.jpg)

The right equipment is the foundation of a successful grow. In this guide, we'll break down each component and help you choose the best option for your budget.

## Lighting

Light is the most important factor. Here are the main types:

### LED Panels (Recommended)
- **Pros**: energy-efficient, low heat, long-lasting
- **Cons**: higher upfront cost
- **Power**: 30-50W per square foot
- **Recommendation**: Samsung LM301B diodes or equivalents

### HPS/MH
- **Pros**: proven technology, powerful light
- **Cons**: high heat, high power consumption
- **Power**: 250W, 400W, 600W

### CFL
- **Pros**: cheap, good for small spaces
- **Cons**: weak output, only suitable for seedlings

## Ventilation

### Inline Fan
- Provides exhaust for hot air
- Size based on tent volume
- Formula: tent volume × 60 = fan CFM

### Carbon Filter
- Eliminates odors
- Connects to inline fan
- Replace every 12-18 months

### Circulation Fans
- Create air movement
- Strengthen plant stems
- 1-2 fans for a standard tent

## Grow Tent

| Size | # Plants | Light Power |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 2×2 ft | 1-2 | 100-150W LED |
| 3×3 ft | 2-3 | 150-250W LED |
| 4×4 ft | 3-4 | 250-400W LED |
| 5×5 ft | 4-6 | 400-600W LED |

## Growing Medium

### Soil (Best for Beginners)
- Forgiving with pH and watering mistakes
- Pre-mixed options: BioBizz Light Mix, Fox Farm Ocean Forest
- Watering pH: 6.0-6.5

### Coco Coir (For Experienced)
- Faster growth, more control
- Requires precise pH (5.5-6.5) and EC
- Needs extra CalMag

## Pots

- **Fabric pots (Smart Pots)**: best root aeration, recommended
- **Plastic pots**: cheaper but poorer drainage
- **Volume**: 3-5 gal for autos, 5-7 gal for photoperiod

## Budget Tiers

### Minimal (Starter)
- Budget LED 100W
- 2×2 tent
- 4" inline fan
- Soil + basic nutrients
- **Total**: ~$150-200

### Optimal
- 240W LED (Samsung diodes)
- 3×3 tent
- Inline fan + carbon filter
- Coco or premium soil
- Full nutrient line
- **Total**: ~$400-500

### Advanced
- 480W LED (top driver)
- 4×4 tent
- Automated watering
- Climate controller
- Professional nutrients
- **Total**: ~$800-1200

## Growie Tip

Use the Growie app to track your climate parameters and keep a grow diary. This will help you understand which equipment works best for your conditions.
