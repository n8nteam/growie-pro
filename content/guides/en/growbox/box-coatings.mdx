# Growbox Coatings: Which One to Choose

![Growbox coatings](/images/guides/box-coatings.jpg)

## Why You Need Reflective Coating

Growbox walls without coating absorb a significant portion of light. As a result, only direct light from the lamp reaches plants, while side illumination is lost. Reflective coating returns scattered light back to plants, which:

- Increases effective illumination by **20–40%** without additional energy costs
- Provides uniform lighting of lower and side parts of plants
- Reduces "dark zones" in the box
- Allows using less powerful lamps with the same results

## Types of Coatings

### Foil Insulation (Penofol)

Foamed polyethylene with aluminum foil. Available in rolls at any hardware store.

- **Reflectivity:** 85–95%
- **Thickness:** 3–10 mm
- **Additionally:** provides thermal insulation of walls

Attached to walls with double-sided tape or glue. Joints are sealed with aluminum tape.

### Mylar

Thin polyester film with metallized coating. The standard coating of most factory grow tents.

- **Reflectivity:** 92–97%
- **Thickness:** 50–100 microns
- **Additionally:** lightweight, doesn't take up useful volume

Avoid folds and creases — they create light concentration points (hot spots).

### Flat White Paint

The simplest and most affordable option. Use specifically matte white paint — glossy creates glare.

- **Reflectivity:** 75–85%
- **Cost:** minimal
- **Additionally:** doesn't create hot spots, maximum uniform diffusion

Apply in 2–3 coats on a pre-primed surface.

### Diamond Foil (Diffuse Film)

Specialized film with a textured "diamond" surface. Designed specifically for growboxes.

- **Reflectivity:** 92–97%
- **Thickness:** 125 microns
- **Additionally:** texture eliminates hot spots, uniform diffusion

## Coating Comparison Table

| Parameter | Foil Insulation | Mylar | White Paint | Diamond Foil |
|-----------|----------------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Reflection, % | 85–95 | 92–97 | 75–85 | 92–97 |
| Cost | Low | Medium | Minimal | High |
| Ease of installation | Medium | Medium | High | Medium |
| Thermal insulation | Yes | No | No | No |
| Hot spot risk | Medium | High | None | None |
| Durability | High | Medium | High | High |
| Moisture resistance | High | Medium | Medium | High |

## Common Mistakes

### Using Regular Aluminum Foil

Household aluminum foil is a **poor choice** for a growbox. It wrinkles easily, creates numerous hot spots, oxidizes from moisture, and deteriorates quickly.

### Glossy Surfaces

Glossy paint or mirrors reflect light directionally rather than diffusely, creating hot spots that can cause leaf burns.

### Uneven Installation

Bubbles, folds, and peeling reduce reflection efficiency and can become a breeding ground for mold.

### Ignoring Floor and Ceiling

Reflective coating is needed not only on walls. The box floor should also be light-colored, and the ceiling around the lamp should effectively reflect light.

## Recommendations

- **Budget wooden box** — flat white paint in 2–3 coats
- **Standard tent** — mylar is already built in, check seam quality
- **Permanent box** — foil insulation for thermal insulation + additional coating if needed
- **Maximum efficiency** — Diamond Foil or quality mylar without creases
