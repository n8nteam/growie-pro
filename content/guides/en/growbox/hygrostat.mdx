# Hygrostat for Humidity Control

![Growbox hygrostat](/images/guides/hygrostat.jpg)

A hygrostat automatically maintains a set humidity level by controlling a humidifier or dehumidifier. Important for humidity-sensitive growth stages.

## Why You Need One

- **Too high humidity** — risk of mold, powdery mildew, root rot
- **Too low humidity** — slowed growth, leaf curling, tip burns
- **Sudden changes** — stress, reduced immunity

## Types

### Mechanical
Based on hygroscopic material. Low accuracy (±5–7%), rarely used.

### Electronic (Digital)
Capacitive or resistive sensors. Accuracy ±2–3%, digital display, hysteresis adjustment. Optimal choice.

## Popular Models

| Model | Range | Accuracy | Relay | Price |
|-------|-------|----------|-------|-------|
| Inkbird IHC-200 | 1–99% RH | ±3% | 10A (1 ch) | $15–25 |
| W3005 | 1–99% RH | ±3% | 10A (2 ch) | $7–12 |
| Sonoff TH16 + sensor | 0–99.9% RH | ±2% | 16A | $15–25 |
| Inkbird IHC-230 | 1–99% RH | ±3% | 15A (2 ch) | $30–40 |

## Connecting to Humidifier

1. Plug hygrostat into mains
2. Plug humidifier into hygrostat outlet
3. Place sensor inside box — centered, at plant level, away from fan airflow
4. Set mode to **humidify** (activates when humidity drops below setpoint)

## Optimal Humidity by Stage

| Stage | Optimal RH | Hygrostat Setpoint |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Germination / clones | 70–80% | 75% (humidify) |
| Seedling | 65–70% | 65% (humidify) |
| Vegetation | 50–60% | 55% (humidify) |
| Early flowering | 45–55% | 50% (dehumidify >55%) |
| Late flowering | 40–50% | 45% (dehumidify) |
| Drying | 45–55% | 50% (dehumidify >55%) |

**Important:** during late flowering, keep humidity below 55–60% to prevent flower mold.

## VPD — Advanced Approach

VPD (Vapor Pressure Deficit) accounts for both temperature and humidity:

- Seedlings / clones: 0.4–0.8 kPa
- Vegetation: 0.8–1.2 kPa
- Flowering: 1.0–1.5 kPa

## Practical Tips

- Mount sensor at canopy height, in shade, away from walls
- Calibrate every 3–6 months with saturated salt solution test (should read 75% after 12 hours)
- Use ultrasonic cool-mist humidifiers
- Ensure condensation drainage
- Combine with thermostat for full climate automation
