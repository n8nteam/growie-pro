# Insulation and Heating for Winter Growing

## Winter Growing Challenges

During winter, growers face several temperature-related problems:

- **Nighttime temperature drops** — when the lamp is off, the box cools down quickly
- **Cold intake air** — ventilation pulls in freezing air from outside or cold air from unheated rooms
- **Condensation** — temperature differences cause moisture on walls, promoting mold
- **Slowed growth** — below 18°C, plant metabolism drops sharply
- **Root zone** — cold floors transfer cold through pots to roots

## Optimal Temperature Ranges by Stage

| Stage | Day temperature | Night temperature | Acceptable difference |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Germination | 24–28°C | 22–25°C | 3–5°C |
| Seedling | 22–26°C | 20–22°C | 4–6°C |
| Vegetation | 22–28°C | 18–22°C | 5–8°C |
| Flowering | 20–26°C | 17–21°C | 5–9°C |
| Ripening | 18–24°C | 15–20°C | 5–8°C |

> **Important:** the day-night temperature difference should not exceed 10°C. Sharp fluctuations cause stress and may trigger hermaphrodite traits.

## Wall Insulation

### Foil Insulation (Penofol)

The optimal option — insulating walls with 5–10 mm foil insulation. The foil side faces inward, providing both thermal insulation and light reflection.

### Polystyrene Foam (Penoplex)

For boxes in unheated spaces (garage, balcony), use 20–50 mm polystyrene panels glued to walls, then covered with reflective material.

### Floor Insulation

Cold floors are a common cause of root problems. Solutions:

- 30–50 mm polystyrene pad under pots
- Wooden pallet with air gap
- Seedling heat mat

## Types of Heating

### Oil Radiators

**Pros:** safe, silent, retain heat long after turning off, don't dry the air.
**Cons:** bulky, slow to heat up, take up space.

### Infrared Heaters

**Pros:** compact, quickly heat objects (not air), energy-efficient.
**Cons:** uneven heating, may dry out plants if positioned incorrectly.

### Fan Heaters

**Pros:** fast heating, compact, inexpensive, provide air circulation.
**Cons:** noisy, dry air significantly, quickly overheat small spaces.

### Heating Cable (Warm Floor)

**Pros:** uniform root zone heating, low energy consumption.
**Cons:** only heats the bottom, doesn't solve cold air problems. Power: 15–25 W/m².

## Heating Automation

### Thermostats

An essential element of winter heating. Recommended settings:

- **Heating on:** when temperature drops to 19°C
- **Heating off:** when reaching 23°C
- **Hysteresis:** 2–3°C to prevent frequent cycling

### Linking with Light Timer

1. **Lamp on** — heater in standby mode (thermostat controls)
2. **Lamp off** — heater active, thermostat maintains night temperature
3. **Emergency cutoff** — heating forcibly turns off above 30°C

## Heating Power Calculation

```
P = V × ΔT × K
```

Where:
- **P** — heater power (W)
- **V** — box volume (m³)
- **ΔT** — difference between target and ambient temperature (°C)
- **K** — heat loss coefficient (15–25 for uninsulated, 8–12 for insulated)

**Example:** box 0.6×0.6×1.4 m = 0.5 m³, raise temp by 10°C, insulated: `P = 0.5 × 10 × 10 = 50 W`

## Practical Tips

1. **Monitor humidity** — heating dries the air, keep a humidifier ready
2. **Don't completely block ventilation** — plants need fresh CO₂ even in winter
3. **Use a thermo-hygrometer with min/max recording** — to see nighttime temperature dips
4. **Warm your watering water** — cold water shocks roots, bring it to 20–22°C
5. **Raise pots off the floor** — even 10 cm of clearance significantly reduces root cooling
