# Stealth Growbox from a PC Case

![Stealth growbox in a PC case](/images/guides/stealth-pc-box.jpg)

A PC tower case is one of the most popular enclosures for a stealth box. It doesn't attract attention, blends into any room, and already has fan mounting points.

## The Stealth Box Concept

Key principles:

- **Visual stealth** — zero light leaks
- **Sound stealth** — quiet ventilation
- **No odor** — carbon filtration
- **Compact size** — one to two plants maximum

## Choosing the Case

| Parameter | Mid Tower | Full Tower | Extended ATX |
|-----------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Height (cm) | 42–48 | 50–58 | 55–65 |
| Width (cm) | 18–20 | 20–22 | 22–25 |
| Depth (cm) | 40–45 | 45–52 | 48–55 |
| Suitability | Poor | Good | Excellent |

## Preparation

1. Remove all internal components
2. Remove unneeded standoffs and blanking plates
3. Drill out rivets, file sharp edges
4. Clean interior with degreaser

## Interior Lining

Line all surfaces with **mylar film** (reflectivity up to 95%) or white matte PVC film. Seal joints with aluminum tape.

## LED Lighting

- **Quantum Board 65–120 W** — best option
- **LED strips** for side lighting
- Driver mounted outside or in separate lower compartment
- Distance to canopy: 15–25 cm

## Ventilation

Use stock 120 mm fan mounts:

- **Intake** (bottom/front) with dust filter
- **Exhaust** (top/rear) through DIY carbon filter
- Silent models: Noctua, Arctic (800–1200 RPM)

### DIY Carbon Filter

Two mesh cylinders of different diameters filled with activated carbon between them.

## Light Traps

Labyrinth from black-painted cardboard on all ventilation openings. Two to three 90° turns.

## Auto-Watering

- 3–5 L reservoir (can be external)
- Mini pump 3–5 W with timer
- 2–3 times daily for 1–2 minutes

## Suitable Strains

- **Low-profile autoflowers** — Lowryder, Easy Bud, Royal Dwarf
- Plants no taller than 30–40 cm
- Short cycle (60–70 days)

## Training: LST

Mandatory. Start at 3rd–4th node. Shape flat canopy at 25–35 cm height.

## Summary

When properly assembled — completely silent, no light or odor leaks. Yield: 15–40 g per plant.
