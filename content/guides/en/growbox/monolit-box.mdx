# Monolith: Building a Permanent Growbox

![Permanent growbox](/images/guides/monolit-box.jpg)

## The "Monolith" Concept

A "Monolith" is a permanent growbox built from construction materials for years of use. Unlike tents, it provides:

- Complete sound insulation
- Excellent thermal insulation
- Rigid structure for heavy equipment
- Integration into interior design
- Maximum light isolation

The project is designed for an **80×80×180 cm** box — the optimal size for 2–3 plants.

## Planning and Design

Before construction, determine:

1. **Installation location** — level floor, access to power outlet, ability to route ventilation
2. **Dimensions** — based on available space and planned number of plants
3. **Budget** — a permanent box costs more than a tent but lasts significantly longer
4. **Access** — the door must provide full access to the interior

## Materials

### Main Sheet Materials

| Material | Thickness | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-----------|------|------|
| Laminated chipboard | 16 mm | Ready surface, moisture-resistant | Heavy, needs cutting |
| Plywood | 12–15 mm | Strong, easy to work with | Needs coating, more expensive |
| OSB-3 | 12 mm | Cheap, moisture-resistant | Rough surface, odor |
| MDF | 16 mm | Smooth surface | Fears moisture |

**Recommendation:** 16 mm laminated chipboard — best balance of price, strength, and ease of processing.

## Required Tools

- Drill / screwdriver
- Wood drill bits (5 mm, 8 mm)
- Hole saw 100–110 mm (for ventilation holes)
- Jigsaw (if cutting yourself)
- Tape measure, square, pencil
- Utility knife, level

## Step-by-Step Assembly

### Step 1: Cutting Parts

For an 80×80×180 cm box:

- **Side walls** — 2 pcs, 80×180 cm
- **Top and bottom** — 2 pcs, 80×76.8 cm
- **Back wall** — 1 pc, 76.8×178.4 cm
- **Door** — 1 pc, 76.8×178.4 cm

### Step 2: Frame Assembly

1. Connect bottom and side walls using confirmat screws, pre-drilling holes
2. Reinforce connections with furniture brackets from inside
3. Install top panel the same way
4. Attach back wall for rigidity
5. Check squareness using level and diagonal measurements

### Step 3: Door Installation

1. Mark hinge positions — top, bottom, and center
2. Screw hinges to door, then to side wall
3. Install magnetic catches for tight closure
4. Apply weatherstrip (D-profile) around door perimeter for light isolation

## Ventilation Holes

Two main holes of 100 mm diameter:

- **Intake** — lower part of back or side wall (10–15 cm from floor)
- **Exhaust** — upper part, opposite side (10–15 cm from ceiling)

Cut with hole saw. Install flanges and seal joints with silicone.

## Electrical Wiring

Inside the box:

- **Junction box** with 10A circuit breaker
- **2–3 outlets** for lamp, fan, additional equipment
- **Cable entry** through a sealed hole

Safety: use minimum 1.5 mm² cable, lever-nut connectors only, mandatory grounding and GFCI.

## Interior Finishing

1. **Seal joints** with silicone sealant
2. **Insulation** (optional) — 5 mm foil insulation, foil side inward
3. **Reflective coating** — flat white paint in 2–3 layers or mylar
4. **Floor waterproofing** — tray or heavy-duty film with raised edges

## Equipment Installation

- **Lighting:** adjustable hangers, 150–250 W LED for 80×80 cm
- **Ventilation:** inline fan on exhaust, carbon filter, passive intake
- **Additional:** thermo-hygrometer, clip fan, light timer, fan speed controller

## Final Checklist

- [ ] Door closes tightly, no light leaks
- [ ] Ventilation works, air is being exchanged
- [ ] Electrical wiring is sound, GFCI trips when tested
- [ ] No sharp edges or protruding screws inside
- [ ] Tray doesn't leak
- [ ] All joints are sealed
