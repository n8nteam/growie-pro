# Space Buckets: Budget Compact Grow Box

## What Is a Space Bucket

A Space Bucket is a compact DIY grow box made from plastic buckets. The concept originated on Reddit and quickly became popular thanks to its minimal cost and simple assembly. Ideal for growing one or two small autoflowering plants in limited space.

The design is a stack of buckets: the bottom one serves as the pot and base, the upper ones form the light chamber. Inside, LED strips provide side lighting and fans ensure air circulation.

## Required Materials

| Material | Quantity | Approximate Price |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| 20 L plastic buckets | 3–4 pcs | $5–10 |
| LED strip 5630 (white) | 5 m | $6–10 |
| LED lamp / UFO LED 50–100 W | 1 pc | $20–35 |
| 120 mm fans (PC type) | 2 pcs | $6–10 |
| 12V 5A power supply | 1 pc | $7–10 |
| Foil or mylar | 2 m² | $3–5 |
| Wires, connectors, zip ties | set | $3–5 |
| Outlet timer | 1 pc | $4–7 |

**Total:** approximately $55–90.

## Step-by-Step Assembly

### Step 1: Preparing the Buckets

1. Wash all buckets and dry them.
2. Keep the bottom bucket's base — it becomes the pot. Drill drainage holes.
3. **Cut the bottoms off** the remaining buckets — they stack as sections.
4. Line interior of all sections with foil or mylar.

### Step 2: Installing Lighting

**Top light:** Mount LED lamp on inside of top bucket's lid.

**Side lighting:** Wrap LED strip in a spiral on inner wall of one section. Connect through 12V power supply. Side light is critical for lower tiers.

### Step 3: Ventilation

1. Cut 120 mm hole in bottom section — **intake fan**.
2. Cut matching hole in top section — **exhaust fan**.
3. Secure fans with screws or zip ties.
4. Intake blows inward, exhaust blows outward.

### Step 4: Final Assembly

1. Place bottom bucket on drip tray.
2. Stack sections on top of each other.
3. Place lid with lamp on top.
4. Check light-tightness.

## Growing Autoflowers in a Space Bucket

- **Light schedule:** 20/4 for the entire cycle.
- **Training is mandatory:** use LST, bending branches toward bucket edges.
- **Plant height:** keep below 40–50 cm. Add sections if needed.
- **Substrate:** light mix (coco + perlite or peat + perlite 70/30).

## Electricity Cost

| Component | Power | Hours/day | kWh/month |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| LED lamp 75 W | 75 W | 20 h | 45 |
| LED strip | 25 W | 20 h | 15 |
| Fans (2 pcs) | 6 W | 24 h | 4.3 |
| **Total** | **106 W** | — | **~64** |

## Tips

- **Don't use transparent buckets** — light must not reach the roots.
- **Watch temperature** — if above 30°C, add a fan or reduce lamp power.
- **Add sections as plant grows** — main advantage of modular design.
