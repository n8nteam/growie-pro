# Indoor Mini Greenhouse for Growing

![Mini greenhouse for growing](/images/guides/mini-greenhouse.jpg)

## What Is a Mini Greenhouse

An indoor mini greenhouse is a compact structure with transparent walls or a lid that creates elevated humidity and stable temperature inside. Unlike a full growbox, a mini greenhouse is mainly designed for:

- Seed germination
- Rooting cuttings (clones)
- Growing seedlings in early stages
- Keeping humidity-loving plants

## Advantages

- **High humidity** — 80–95% without additional equipment
- **Stable temperature** — greenhouse effect smooths out fluctuations
- **Compact size** — fits on a windowsill or shelf
- **Low cost** — budget options start from $5–10
- **Easy to use** — doesn't require electricity in basic configuration

## Types of Mini Greenhouses

### Tabletop Propagators

Plastic tray with transparent lid, 30–50 cm long. Lid has ventilation openings for humidity control. Best for seed germination and small cuttings.

### Shelf Greenhouses

Metal or plastic shelf unit with 3–5 tiers, covered with transparent zippered film. Height 100–160 cm. For large quantities of seedlings.

### With Lighting

Propagator or shelf with built-in LED lighting. Allows growing seedlings regardless of natural light.

### With Bottom Heating

Propagators with built-in heat mat maintaining substrate temperature at 22–26°C. Significantly speeds up germination.

## Using for Seedlings and Clones

### Seed Germination

1. Fill cell trays with moist substrate (coco coir, peat pellets, or light soil)
2. Plant seeds at 0.5–1 cm depth
3. Close the lid and place in a warm spot (24–27°C)
4. Ventilate 1–2 times daily for 10–15 minutes
5. After sprouts appear, open ventilation holes
6. 5–7 days after sprouting, remove the lid and provide lighting

### Rooting Cuttings

1. Cut the clone at a 45° angle just below a node
2. Treat the cut with rooting stimulator (Clonex, Rootone)
3. Place in a Root Riot cube, peat pellet, or glass of water
4. Close the lid — humidity should be 85–95%
5. Provide soft diffused light (not direct rays)
6. Roots appear within 7–14 days

## Optimal Conditions

| Parameter | Seeds | Cuttings | Seedlings |
|-----------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Air temperature | 24–28°C | 22–26°C | 20–25°C |
| Substrate temperature | 25–28°C | 23–26°C | 20–24°C |
| Air humidity | 85–95% | 85–95% | 60–75% |
| Lighting | Not needed until sprouting | 16–18 hours soft light | 16–18 hours |
| Ventilation | 1–2 times/day | 1–2 times/day | Lid open |

## Budget DIY Options

- **Plastic food container** — transparent container with lid, perfect for germination
- **Cut plastic bottle** — placed over a cup with seedling as a dome
- **Ziplock bag** — placed over a pot to create a greenhouse effect
- **Aquarium** — old aquarium covered with glass or film

> **Tip:** whatever option you choose, always ensure proper ventilation. Stagnant air at high humidity is a direct path to mold and rot.
