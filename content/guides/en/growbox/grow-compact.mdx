# Compact Grow Box: Small Space Solution

![Compact grow](/images/guides/grow-compact.jpg)

## The Compact Grow Concept

A compact grow box is a miniature growbox designed for limited space. Typical dimensions: 30–50 cm wide and deep, 50–80 cm tall. Despite the modest size, with the right approach, you can grow a full harvest.

A compact box is suitable if:

- You live in a small apartment and can't dedicate space for a full-size box
- You want to try growing with minimal investment
- You're growing 1 compact plant
- You need stealth — a discreet box disguised as a household item

## Suitable Dimensions

| Size (W×D×H) | Volume | Suitable for | Comment |
|---------------|--------|-------------|---------|
| 30×30×50 cm | 45 L | Microgreens, seedlings | Vegetation only |
| 35×35×60 cm | 74 L | 1 miniature plant | Requires intensive training |
| 40×40×70 cm | 112 L | 1 compact plant | Optimal minimum for full cycle |
| 50×50×80 cm | 200 L | 1–2 plants | Comfortable compact grow |

> **Important:** in a compact space, every centimeter counts. Lamp height + distance from lamp to canopy + pot height = "dead zone." In a 70 cm tall box, only 30–35 cm remains for the plant.

## Ventilation for Small Volumes

In compact spaces, overheating is the main problem.

### Fan Options

- **120 mm PC fans** — quiet, cheap, 12V power
- **75–100 mm inline fan** — for carbon filter installation
- **USB fans** — for the most compact boxes

Box volume should be replaced **every 1–3 minutes**.

## Choosing Lighting

### LED Strips

- **Power:** 15–30 W for 30×30 cm box
- **Pros:** minimal height profile, even distribution, low heat

### Small Quantum Boards

- **Power:** 30–60 W for 40×40 cm box
- **Pros:** high efficiency (2.5–3.0 µmol/J), full spectrum

| Box Size | LED Strip | Quantum Board |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| 30×30 cm | 15–25 W | 25–35 W |
| 40×40 cm | 25–40 W | 40–60 W |
| 50×50 cm | 40–60 W | 60–80 W |

## LST and Training for Limited Space

### Low Stress Training (LST)

1. Start LST at the 3rd–4th node (when plant reaches 10–15 cm)
2. Gently bend the top toward the pot edge and secure
3. As side branches grow — bend them too
4. Goal — a flat, even "canopy" of tops at the same height

### Topping / FIM

- **Topping** — cutting the main growth tip. One top becomes two.
- **FIM** — removing 75% of the top. Can produce 3–4 new shoots.

### ScrOG (Screen of Green)

Installing a screen 15–20 cm above the pot. Ideal technique for compact spaces.

## Tips for Micro Growing

1. **Choose compact genetics** — autoflowers, dwarf varieties, indica-dominant hybrids
2. **Use small pots** — 3–5 liters is enough to limit plant size
3. **Start training early** — don't let the plant stretch
4. **Monitor temperature** — overheating happens quickly in small volumes
5. **Water more often, but less** — substrate dries faster in small pots
6. **Use a timer** — automate at least lighting
