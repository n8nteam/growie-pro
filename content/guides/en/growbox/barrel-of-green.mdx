# Barrel of Green: Cylindrical Growbox

![Barrel of Green](/images/guides/barrel-of-green.jpg)

Barrel Of Green is a cylindrical growbox concept where plants are placed along the inner wall of a barrel, with the light source positioned vertically in the center.

## Concept and Advantages

- **Even light distribution** — central source equidistant from all walls
- **Compact footprint** — a 200 L barrel occupies only ~0.3 m²
- **Vertical planting** — up to 20–30 spots on different tiers
- **Efficient volume use** — higher fill ratio than rectangular box

## Choosing a Barrel

| Parameter | Plastic | Metal |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Volume | 200 L | 200 L |
| Diameter | ~58 cm | ~58 cm |
| Height | ~90 cm | ~88 cm |
| Insulation | Good | Poor |
| Workability | Easy | Harder |

Recommended: **food-grade plastic barrel**.

## Barrel Preparation

1. Wash interior with soapy water
2. Cut holes for pots (7–10 cm) in staggered pattern — 4–6 per tier, 3–5 tiers
3. Cut top hole for exhaust fan (120–150 mm)
4. Drill bottom intake holes (4–6 at 30 mm)
5. Paint interior white or line with mylar

## Vertical Plant Arrangement

Plants in net pots inserted into barrel wall holes. Inside: geotextile cylinder filled with substrate (perlite, vermiculite, coco coir).

## Central Lighting

- **Full-spectrum LED tube** 60–80 cm
- **LED strip** wound on transparent cylinder
- **Power** — 80–150 W total
- Driver mounted outside to reduce heat

## Ventilation

- **Exhaust on top** — 120–150 mm inline fan with carbon filter
- **Intake at bottom** — passive, through bottom holes
- Air exchange: full volume every 2–3 minutes

## Watering System

Top-down drip irrigation: ring tube with drippers at top, solution flows down feeding all tiers, drip tray at bottom, pump on timer 3–4 times daily.

## Suitable Plants

- Lettuce, arugula, spinach — fast growth, compact roots
- Strawberries — thrive vertically
- Herbs — basil, mint, parsley
- Dwarf tomatoes — cherry varieties
- Microgreens — upper tiers

## Expected Results

20–30 plants on 0.3 m², continuous harvest, 100–200 W consumption, fresh greens year-round.
