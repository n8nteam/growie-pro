# Emergency Growbox Shutdown System

![Emergency growbox shutdown](/images/guides/stealth-shutdown.jpg)

Quick and silent growbox shutdown may be needed in various situations. A well-designed system allows you to cut power in seconds and restore operation without harming plants.

## Why You Need It

- **Stealth** — eliminating noise and light when others are present
- **Safety** — emergency power cut during leaks or overheating
- **Remote control** — managing the box when away
- **Automation** — responding to sensor readings automatically

## Implementation Options

### GSM Relay
Control via SMS or phone call. Works without Wi-Fi. 1–4 channels, $25–60.

### Wi-Fi Smart Plugs
Control through smartphone app. Tuya, Sonoff S26, TP-Link Kasa. $7–20 each.

### Arduino / ESP32
DIY controller with relay module. Web interface, Telegram bot, MQTT. Up to 8+ channels, $15–35.

## Wiring

Connect each system through a separate relay:

- **Channel 1** — Lighting (LED driver)
- **Channel 2** — Exhaust ventilation
- **Channel 3** — Circulation fan
- **Channel 4** — Watering pump

Master power through a **main breaker** for emergency all-off.

## Correct Shutdown Sequence

### Emergency
1. **Lighting** — off first
2. **Watering / pump** — off second
3. **Ventilation** — off last (run 30–60 sec to clear odor)

### Planned
1. **Watering** — stop 15 min before
2. **Lighting** — off
3. **Ventilation** — leave 5–10 min for airing, then off

## Recovery

1. **Ventilation** — on first (5 min before light)
2. **Lighting** — on at reduced power, ramp over an hour
3. **Watering** — resume on schedule

## Impact on Plants

| Duration | Consequences | Action |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Up to 2 hours | Minimal | None needed |
| 2–6 hours | Mild stress | Continue as normal |
| 6–12 hours | Noticeable stress | Add stress reliever |
| 12–24 hours | Serious stress | Gradual recovery |
| Over 24 hours | Risk of harvest loss | Check roots and leaves |

## Tips

- Keep the "panic button" easily accessible
- Test the shutdown system in advance
- Set up phone notifications
- Install UPS for proper controller shutdown
