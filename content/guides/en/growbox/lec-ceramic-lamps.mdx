# Ceramic Metal Halide Lamps (LEC/CMH)

## What Is LEC/CMH

LEC (Light Emitting Ceramic) and CMH (Ceramic Metal Halide) are **ceramic metal halide lamps**, an improved version of classic metal halide (MH) lamps. They use a **ceramic arc tube** instead of quartz.

Despite the LEC abbreviation, these lamps **are not LEDs** — the name was coined by Sun System as a marketing term. The correct technical name is CMH.

## How They Work

The ceramic arc tube operates at higher temperature and pressure than quartz, providing:

1. **Stable spectrum** — consistent throughout the lamp's lifespan
2. **High CRI** — 90–96 (HPS ~25, standard MH 65–70)
3. **Efficiency** — up to 1.9 µmol/J, comparable to budget LEDs
4. **Longevity** — 20,000+ hours with minimal spectrum degradation

## Light Spectrum

CMH's main advantage is a **broad and balanced spectrum**, close to sunlight:

- Full **380–780 nm** coverage
- Significant **blue** (440–460 nm) — compact growth and resin production
- Sufficient **red** (620–670 nm) — flowering
- **UV-A and UV-B** — unique feature not found in HPS or most LEDs

### Available Spectra

- **3100K** — universal, full cycle, emphasis on flowering
- **4200K** — more blue, better for vegetation
- **10,000K** — specialized UV lamp

## Comparison with HPS and LED

| Parameter | CMH 315W | HPS 400W | LED 300W |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Efficiency (µmol/J) | 1.7–1.9 | 1.5–1.7 | 2.0–2.8 |
| CRI | 90–96 | 22–25 | 70–90 |
| UV emission | Yes | Minimal | Usually none |
| Heat output | Medium | High | Low |
| Lifespan | 20,000 h | 10,000 h | 50,000 h |

## Power and Coverage

### CMH 315W
- **Coverage:** 80×80 cm (veg), 60×60 cm (flower)
- **Distance to canopy:** 40–50 cm

### CMH 630W (Dual)
- **Coverage:** 120×120 cm (veg), 100×100 cm (flower)
- **Distance to canopy:** 50–60 cm

## UV Component

- **UVA (315–400 nm)** — stimulates resin and terpene production
- **UVB (280–315 nm)** — enhances trichome production

**Important:** UV is dangerous for eyes. Use protective glasses with UVA/UVB filter.

## Usage Recommendations

- Choose **CMH 315W with 3100K** for the full cycle
- Use quality electronic ballast
- Replace lamp **every 12–18 months**
- Don't touch bulb with bare hands
- Let lamp cool **15 minutes** before re-striking
- Install **strictly horizontal**

## Lamp Type Comparison

| Criterion | CMH/LEC | HPS | LED | CFL |
|-----------|---------|-----|-----|-----|
| Efficiency | ★★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★ |
| Spectrum | ★★★★★ | ★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★ |
| Heat output | ★★★ | ★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★ |
| Harvest quality | ★★★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★ |
| UV emission | ★★★★★ | ★ | ★ | ★ |

**Bottom line:** CMH/LEC is the golden middle ground between HPS and LED — superior spectrum and quality at reasonable price.
