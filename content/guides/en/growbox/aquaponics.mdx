# Aquaponics: Growing with a Working Aquarium

![Aquaponics for growing](/images/guides/aquaponics.jpg)

## Aquaponics Principles

Aquaponics is a closed-loop ecosystem combining **aquarium fish farming** and **hydroponic plant cultivation**. Fish produce waste, bacteria convert it into nutrients, and plants absorb those nutrients, cleaning the water for the fish.

For a grower, aquaponics means **free organic fertilizers** and minimal maintenance after setup.

## The Nitrogen Cycle

1. **Fish** excrete ammonia (NH3) through gills and waste.
2. **Nitrosomonas bacteria** oxidize ammonia to nitrites (NO2-).
3. **Nitrobacter bacteria** oxidize nitrites to nitrates (NO3-).
4. **Plants** absorb nitrates as their primary nitrogen source.
5. **Cleaned water** returns to the fish.

Starting the nitrogen cycle takes **4–6 weeks**.

## Suitable Fish

| Fish Species | Water Temp | Difficulty | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|------------|-------|
| Tilapia | 22–30°C | Low | Fast growing, lots of waste |
| Goldfish | 18–24°C | Low | Ideal for beginners |
| Koi carp | 15–25°C | Medium | Requires large volume |
| Guppies | 22–28°C | Low | For small systems |
| Catfish | 24–30°C | Medium | Fast growth, hardy |
| Trout | 10–18°C | High | Cold-water, O2 sensitive |

## System Design

### Main Components

- **Aquarium:** minimum 100 liters
- **Grow bed:** container with clay pebbles or gravel
- **Pump:** moves water from aquarium to grow bed
- **Bell siphon:** auto-drains grow bed back to aquarium
- **Aerator:** provides oxygen to fish and root zone

### Design Types

1. **Media bed** — simplest, best for beginners
2. **NFT** — thin water stream, suited for greens
3. **DWC** — roots float in aerated filtered water, for advanced growers

## Suitable Plants

### Grow Excellently
- Lettuce, arugula, spinach, basil, mint, cilantro, dill, strawberries

### Grow in Mature Systems (6+ months)
- Tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, eggplants

### Not Suitable
- Root vegetables — no suitable substrate
- Plants requiring pH below 5.5 — would kill the fish

## System Startup

1. **Week 1–2:** Assemble, fill with water, start pump and aerator. Add ammonia source.
2. **Week 2–4:** Test water daily. Wait for nitrites, then nitrates.
3. **Week 4–6:** When ammonia and nitrites hit zero and nitrates rise — cycle established.
4. **Add fish:** Start with 2–3. Gradually increase over a month.
5. **Plant:** After parameters stabilize.

## Maintenance

- **Daily:** feed fish, check water temp and pump.
- **Weekly:** test pH (6.8–7.2), ammonia, nitrites, nitrates. Top up water.
- **Monthly:** clean filter, check roots, remove dead leaves.
- **Never:** use pesticides or chemical fertilizers.

## Advantages and Limitations

**Advantages:** organic growing, 90% water savings, free fertilizer, educational project.

**Limitations:** long startup (4–6 weeks), pH compromise (6.8–7.0), no synthetic fertilizers, electricity dependent.
