![Ready-made hydroponic growbox](/images/guides/ready-hydro-box.jpg)

A ready-made hydroponic growbox is a complete "out of the box" solution where all components are selected and configured to work together.

## Advantages

- **Quick start** — unpack, assemble, launch
- **Component compatibility** — selected by manufacturer
- **Warranty and support**
- **Aesthetic appearance**
- **Documentation** included

## What to Look For

### Size

Minimum height for full growing: 120 cm (pot + lamp + distance between them).

### Hydroponic System Type

| System | Difficulty | Best For | Maintenance |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| DWC | Low | Beginners | Simple |
| NFT | Medium | Greens | Moderate |
| Drip irrigation | Low | Universal | Simple |
| Aeroponics | High | Experienced | Complex |
| Ebb & Flow | Medium | Universal | Moderate |

### Lighting

- Full spectrum LED, minimum 100 W per 0.5 m²
- Dimmer is a plus
- Peaks in red (620–660 nm) and blue (440–460 nm)

## Setup After Purchase

1. Check light-tightness

4. Test run 24 hours without plants
5. Prepare solution at half dosage

## Maintenance
