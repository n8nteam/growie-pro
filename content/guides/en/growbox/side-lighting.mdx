# Side Lighting in a Growbox

## Why You Need Side Lighting

The main light is positioned above. Top leaves get maximum light, lower tiers end up in shade. At 60 cm from the lamp, intensity is only **25%** of the value at 30 cm.

Side lighting delivers light directly to lower and middle tiers. Experiments show side lighting can increase yield by **10–20%**.

## Suitable Lamps

### LED Strips
- SMD 5630 or 2835, white (3000–4000K), 14–20 W/m
- Flexible, thin, easy to mount on walls

### Compact Fluorescent (CFL)
- CFL 23–45 W, E27 socket, 2700K or 6500K
- Cheap, can be placed 5–10 cm from plants

### LED Bars
- Aluminum profiles with Samsung LM301B, 20–50 W per bar
- High efficiency, directed light, good heat dissipation

## Placement

![Optimal side lighting layout](/images/guides/side-lighting-diagram.jpg)

- Place at the **middle and lower third** level of the plant
- LED bar to plant: **15–25 cm**
- CFL to plant: **5–15 cm**
- Don't place side light too high — it should supplement, not duplicate top light

## Effectiveness by Stage

| Stage | Effectiveness | Comment |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| Seedling | Low | Top light is sufficient |
| Early vegetation | Medium | Start at 20+ cm height |
| Late vegetation | High | Lower branches get shaded |
| Flowering | Maximum | Lower flowers gain weight |

## Additional Power Calculation

Side lighting should be **15–25%** of main light power.

| Main Light | Side Lighting | Type |
|-----------|---------------|------|
| 100 W | 15–25 W | LED strip (5 m) |
| 200 W | 30–50 W | 2 LED bars at 20 W |
| 300 W | 45–75 W | 2–3 LED bars at 25 W |

## Results Comparison

| Parameter | Without | With | Difference |
|-----------|---------|------|------------|
| Total harvest | 100% | 112–120% | +12–20% |
| Lower flower weight | Low | Medium–high | +40–60% |
| Energy consumption | 100% | 115–125% | +15–25% |

**Conclusion:** side lighting is one of the most effective ways to increase yield without replacing the main fixture.
