# Direct to Soil Germination: Natural Method

![Direct soil germination](/images/guides/direct-soil-method.jpg)

Direct soil germination is the most natural method — exactly how plants germinate in nature. Less stress, fewer manipulations, but requires patience and faith.

## Why This Method is Good

### Advantages ✅

**1. Minimum Stress**
- No transplant
- Root grows immediately in final medium
- Plant adapts from day one

**2. Simplicity**
- Place seed → water → wait
- No daily monitoring needed
- Hard to mess up

**3. Naturalness**
- How plants germinate in nature
- Root finds nutrition immediately
- Soil microbiota helps

**4. Less Equipment**
- Only pot and soil
- No towels, glasses needed

### Disadvantages ❌

**1. No Visual Control**
- Can't see what's happening
- Unknown if seed germinated
- Requires patience

**2. Longer Wait**
- 3-7 days until seedling appears
- Vs 1-2 days on towel

**3. Harder Moisture Control**
- Can dry out
- Or overwater

**4. Lower Germination Rate**
- 85-90% vs 95% on towel
- Especially for old seeds

## When to Use

### Ideal for:
✅ Outdoor grows (direct planting in ground)
✅ Autoflowers (don't like transplant)
✅ Beginners (simplicity)
✅ Large quantity of seeds

### Not Recommended:
❌ Expensive rare seeds (too risky)
❌ Old seeds (>3gt;3 years)
❌ If need process control

## What to Prepare

### Required

☐ **Pot**
  - Size: 0.5-1L (1-2 pints) for start
  - Drainage holes mandatory!
  - Or final pot for autos (2-3 gallons / 7-11L)

☐ **Soil**
  - Light starter (Seed Starter, Light Mix)
  - pH 6.0-6.5
  - Loose, airy

☐ **Water**
  - Settled 24 hours
  - Room temperature
  - pH 6.0-6.5

☐ **Spray bottle**
  - For gentle watering

☐ **Clear cup/dome**
  - For creating humidity dome

## Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Prepare Soil

**Soil Choice:**
- BioBizz Light Mix
- Plagron Seed Mix
- Universal soil + 30% perlite

**Moistening:**
1. Fill pot with soil (don't compact!)
2. Moisten from spray bottle
3. Should be damp, not wet
4. Test: when squeezed, holds shape but no water drips

### Step 2: Make Hole

**Depth:**
- Rule: 2× seed size depth
- Usually: 0.5-1 inch (1-1.5cm)
- **No deeper!** 1.5 inches (2cm) = too deep

**Tool:**
- Pencil
- Chopstick
- Finger

### Step 3: Place Seed

**Orientation:**
- **Ideal**: taproot down (if already sprouted slightly)
- **Good**: sideways
- **Normal**: any side (seed will find up)

**Carefully:**
- Don't press seed
- Place gently

### Step 4: Cover with Soil

- Gently cover hole
- **Don't compact!**
- Soil should be loose
- Light finger touch — enough

### Step 5: Moisten Surface

- Mist from spray bottle
- 5-10 sprays
- Don't pour stream! (will wash out seed)

### Step 6: Create Dome

**Why:**
- Maintain humidity
- Create warm environment
- Speed germination

**How:**
1. Cover with clear cup
2. Or cut plastic bottle
3. Or plastic wrap with holes

**Important:**
- Must have air circulation (small holes)
- Open once daily for 10 minutes (ventilation)

### Step 7: Conditions

**Temperature:**
- Soil: 72-77°F (22-25°C)
- Air: 72-81°F (22-27°C)
- If cold — use heat mat under pot

**Light:**
- **Before germination**: not needed (darkness)
- **After germination**: LED 18/6, distance 16-20 inches (40-50cm)

**Humidity:**
- 65-75%
- Dome maintains automatically

### Step 8: Wait and Observe

**Day 1-2:**
- Nothing happening (externally)
- Seed swelling inside soil

**Day 3-5:**
- Seedling breaks surface!
- First see seed shell or stem loop

**Day 5-7:**
- Cotyledons (round leaves) open
- Remove dome gradually

**If nothing happened in 7 days:**
- Wait another 3-5 days
- **Don't dig up seed!**
- Old seeds may take 10-14 days

## Watering Rules

### Before Germination (first 3-7 days)

**Daily:**
- Check top layer moisture
- If dry — mist from spray bottle
- 5-10 sprays

**DON'T POUR STREAM!**
- Will wash out seed
- Will push to surface
- Will compact soil

### After Germination

**First 3-5 days:**
- Continue misting
- Keep dome for now

**After Removing Dome:**
- Water when top layer (0.5-1 inch / 1-2cm) dry
- Small portions
- Soil damp, not wet

## Problems and Solutions

### Problem 1: Seedling Didn't Appear in 7 Days

**Possible Causes:**
- Planted too deep
- Soil dried out
- Seed old/dead
- Temperature too low

**What to Do:**
1. Check soil moisture (should be damp)
2. Check temperature (72-77°F / 22-25°C?)
3. Wait another 3-5 days
4. If &gt;10 days — seed dead

**DON'T DIG UP!**
- Can damage taproot
- Patience!

### Problem 2: Seedling Appeared but Shell Won't Drop

**Solution:**
1. Mist shell with water (softens)
2. Wait 12-24 hours
3. If doesn't help — carefully help with tweezers

### Problem 3: Seedling Stretched

**Cause:**
- Light too far or weak
- Or turned on light before germination

**Solution:**
- Add soil around stem (support)
- Bring light closer to 12-16 inches (30-40cm)
- Next time: light only after germination!

### Problem 4: Soil Covered with Mold

**Cause:**
- Overwatering
- Poor circulation

**Solution:**
1. Remove moldy top layer
2. Remove dome
3. Improve ventilation
4. Water less frequently

## Advanced Techniques

### For Autoflowers

**Plant in Final Pot:**
- Autos don't like transplant
- Use 2-3 gallons (7-11L) immediately
- Plant in center of pot

**Plus:**
- No transplant stress
- Roots grow freely immediately

**Minus:**
- Harder to control watering (large volume)
- Soil and nutrient waste

### Additives When Planting

**Mycorrhizae:**
- Sprinkle on hole bottom
- Beneficial fungi help roots
- Increases germination and growth

**Trichoderma:**
- Protection from fungal diseases
- Add to soil before planting

**Root Stimulator:**
- Water after planting with root stimulator solution
- Speeds root development

## Growie's Tip

Direct soil planting is my choice for autoflowers. They don't like transplant stress, and this method gives them best start. Main thing — don't panic and don't dig up seed! Nature knows what it's doing. Wait 7-10 days, maintain moisture and warmth. Record in Growie planting date and germination date — you'll understand average timelines for your conditions!
