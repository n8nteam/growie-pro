# Germination Problems and Solutions

![Germination problems](/images/guides/germination-problems.jpg)

Not all seeds germinate perfectly. Sometimes problems arise, but most are solvable. Let's cover all scenarios and saving methods.

## Problem 1: Seed Won't Germinate

### Expected Timeline Passed

**Normal Timelines:**
- Fresh seeds: 2-5 days
- Old (>2gt;2 years): 5-10 days
- Very old (>5gt;5 years): 10-14 days

**When to Worry:**
- &gt;7 days no signs (fresh seeds)
- &gt;14 days no signs (any seeds)

### Cause 1.1: Wrong Temperature

**Symptoms:**
- Long wait (>7gt;7 days)
- Seed hard, not swelling

**Diagnosis:**
- Measure temperature where seeds stored
- Too cold (<6lt;68°F / 20°C) or hot (>8gt;82°F / 28°C)

**Solution:**
✅ Optimal: 72-77°F (22-25°C)
✅ Move to warmer spot
✅ Use heat mat
✅ Or top of fridge

**Prevention:**
- Always check temperature with thermometer
- Stable temperature more important than high

### Cause 1.2: Dead/Old Seed

**Symptoms:**
- &gt;10-14 days no signs
- Seed soft when pressed
- No swelling

**Diagnosis:**
- Inspect seed:
  - Green/white (immature/dead)
  - Cracked, damaged
  - Soft (squishes in fingers)

**Solution:**
❌ If seed dead — can't save
✅ Try last chance:
  1. Scarification (rub with sandpaper)
  2. Peroxide soak 3% for 24 hours
  3. Stimulator
  4. Wait another 5-7 days

**Prevention:**
- Buy from verified breeders
- Store properly (fridge, darkness, dryness)
- Check expiration date

### Cause 1.3: Planted Too Deep

**Symptoms:**
- Seed germinated (visible with careful dig)
- But seedling didn't break surface

**Diagnosis:**
- If planted deeper than 1 inch (2cm)
- &gt;7 days passed

**Solution:**
✅ Carefully dig top layer (0.5 inch / 1cm)
✅ If see seedling — help it:
  - Remove some soil on top
  - Moisten surface

**Prevention:**
- Planting depth: 0.5-1 inch (1-1.5cm) maximum
- Rule: 2× seed size depth

### Cause 1.4: Dried Out

**Symptoms:**
- Paper towel/soil dry
- Seed hard, didn't swell

**Diagnosis:**
- Check medium moisture
- When last watered/moistened?

**Solution:**
✅ Immediately moisten
✅ Maintain constant moisture
✅ Wait another 3-5 days

**Prevention:**
- Check moisture twice daily
- Use dome (cover with cup/wrap)

### Cause 1.5: Overwatering / Rot

**Symptoms:**
- Seed soft, black
- Unpleasant smell
- Mold around

**Diagnosis:**
- Medium too wet (water drips when squeezed)
- No air circulation

**Solution:**
❌ If seed blackened and smells — dead
✅ If still signs of life:
  1. Extract seed
  2. Rinse in 3% peroxide (5 minutes)
  3. Dry 10-15 minutes
  4. Transfer to new dry medium (damp, not wet)

**Prevention:**
- Damp but not soaked (no water drips when squeezed)
- Ventilation (air dome twice daily)
- Don't keep in water glass &gt;48 hours

## Problem 2: Taproot Appeared but Not Growing

### Cause 2.1: Cold

**Symptoms:**
- Taproot 0.2 inches (0.5cm) and stopped
- 2-3 days passed without growth

**Solution:**
✅ Raise temperature to 72-77°F (22-25°C)
✅ Ensure moisture maintained

### Cause 2.2: Taproot Dried

**Symptoms:**
- Taproot brown/gray (should be white)
- Dry to touch

**Solution:**
❌ Taproot died — seed won't recover

**Prevention:**
- Don't keep seed with taproot in air
- Immediately transplant or moisten medium

### Cause 2.3: Taproot Damage

**Symptoms:**
- Taproot broken/torn
- Growth slowed

**Solution:**
✅ If partially damaged:
  - Plant carefully in soil
  - 50% chance of recovery
❌ If completely torn off — won't recover

**Prevention:**
- Don't touch taproot with hands!
- Use tweezers (hold seed, not root)
- Transplant at 0.5-1 inch (1-2cm) length (don't wait &gt;1.5 inches / 3cm)

## Problem 3: Seedling "Helmet" Won't Drop

### What It Is

**"Helmet head":**
- Seed shell stuck on cotyledons
- Cotyledons can't open

**Causes:**
- Insufficient humidity
- Too shallow planting
- Hard shell (old seeds)

### Solution

**Option 1: Wait (Patience)**
- Mist "helmet" with water 2-3 times daily
- Moisture softens shell
- In 24-48 hours may fall off

**Option 2: Help Manually (Carefully!)**

**Instructions:**
1. **Moisten shell heavily** (spray bottle)
2. **Wait 10-15 minutes** (softening)
3. **Repeat moistening**
4. **Carefully open with tweezers:**
   - Hold plant with one hand (stem)
   - Other hand with tweezers open shell
   - Start from edges, not middle
   - **Be very careful!**

**Risks:**
- Can damage cotyledons
- If unsure — better wait

**Prevention:**
- Maintain high humidity (65-75%)
- Plant at correct depth (0.5-1 inch / 1-1.5cm)
- Use dome (cup/wrap)

## Problem 4: Seedling Stretched

### Symptoms

- Stem long (2-4 inches / 5-10cm) and thin
- Cotyledons small
- Plant falling/bending

### Causes

**1. Light Too Far or Weak**
- Plant stretches toward light
- LED at distance &gt;20 inches (50cm)
- Or insufficient power

**2. Light On Before Germination**
- Seedling stretches underground

**3. Too Hot**
- Temperature &gt;82°F (28°C)

### Solution

**Immediately:**
✅ Bring light closer to 12-16 inches (30-40cm)
✅ Add soil around stem (support)
✅ Lower temperature to 72-77°F (22-25°C)

**Support:**
- Use toothpick as support
- Tie stem with soft string/wire

**Prevention:**
- Light only AFTER germination
- LED 18/6 at 16 inches (40cm) distance
- Temperature 72-77°F (22-25°C)

## Problem 5: Seedling Fell (Damping Off)

### What It Is

**"Damping off":**
- Fungal disease
- Stem at base blackens and thins
- Plant falls over

### Causes

- Overwatering
- Poor air circulation
- Infected soil
- Too cold

### Symptoms

- Stem at base black/brown
- Thinned
- Plant toppled

### Solution

❌ Usually incurable — plant will die
✅ Attempt save (10-20% chance):
1. Cut affected part
2. Treat with fungicide (Trichoderma-based products)
3. Transplant to fresh sterile soil
4. Improve ventilation

### Prevention

**Before Germination:**
✅ Sterile soil / pellets
✅ Seed treatment (3% peroxide, 10 minutes)

**During Growth:**
✅ Don't overwater! (damp, not soaked)
✅ Ventilation (air dome)
✅ Temperature 72-77°F (22-25°C)
✅ Add Trichoderma to soil (protection)

## Problem 6: Mold on Seeds / in Soil

### Symptoms

- White fluffy coating on seeds
- Mold on soil surface
- Cloudy water (glass method)

### Causes

- Overwatering
- Poor circulation
- Infected medium
- Too warm (>8gt;81°F / 27°C)

### Solution

**On Seeds:**
1. Extract seed
2. Rinse in 3% peroxide (5-10 minutes)
3. Dry 10-15 minutes
4. Place in new clean medium

**In Soil:**
1. Remove moldy top layer
2. Treat with beneficial fungus products
3. Improve ventilation
4. Water less frequently

### Prevention

✅ Air dome twice daily
✅ Damp but not soaked
✅ Air circulation
✅ Temperature 72-77°F (22-25°C) (no higher)
✅ Sterile soil/tools

## Emergency Saving Methods

### "Old Seed Resuscitation" Method

**For seeds &gt;5 years or seemingly dead:**

1. **Scarification:**
   - Rub between fine sandpaper sheets
   - 10-15 seconds
   - Damage shell (but don't crush!)

2. **Peroxide Soak:**
   - 3% hydrogen peroxide
   - 24 hours
   - Softens + disinfects

3. **Rinse:**
   - Clean water 72-75°F (22-24°C)

4. **Stimulator:**
   - Germination stimulator solution
   - Soak 2-4 hours

5. **Warm Moist Medium:**
   - Paper towel / pellet
   - 77-81°F (25-27°C) (slightly warmer than usual)
   - Wait 10-14 days

**Chances:** 30-50% for very old seeds

## When to Give Up on Seed

### Dead Seed Signs

❌ &gt;14 days no signs of life (fresh seeds)
❌ &gt;21 days (old seeds) with all methods applied
❌ Black/soft seed with rotten smell
❌ Completely cracked/crumbled
❌ Seed flattened when lightly pressed

### What to Do

1. Try 1-2 more seeds of same strain
2. If same problems — bad seed batch
3. Contact seller (replacement/refund)

## Diagnostic Table

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Won't germinate 7+ days | Cold/old/deep | Heat 72-77°F, scarification, check depth |
| Taproot not growing | Cold/dried | Heat, moisture |
| "Helmet" won't drop | Dryness/hard shell | Mist, help with tweezers |
| Stretched | Light far/weak | Light 12-16", add soil |
| Fell (damping off) | Overwatering/fungus | Transplant, fungicide, ventilation |
| Mold | Over-saturation | Rinse in peroxide, ventilate |
| Taproot brown | Dried/rot | If dry — can't save, if rot — rinse peroxide |

## Growie's Tip

90% germination problems relate to overwatering or wrong temperature. Buy $5 thermometer and always check conditions! If seed didn't germinate in 7 days — don't panic, try emergency measures (scarification + stimulator). Keep diary in Growie: record each problem and solution — you'll develop system for your conditions. Remember: even experienced growers sometimes lose seeds — it's part of the process!
