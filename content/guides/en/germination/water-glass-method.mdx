# Water Glass Method: Quick Germination

![Water glass method](/images/guides/water-glass-method.jpg)

Water glass method is the fastest germination technique. It's especially good for old seeds with hard shells and when you need maximum speed.

## When to Use This Method

### Ideal for:
✅ **Old seeds** (>2gt;2 years) — shell softens faster
✅ **Hard shell** — water penetrates inside
✅ **Quick start** — germination in 24-48 hours
✅ **Thick-shelled strains**

### Not Recommended:
❌ Weak/damaged seeds
❌ No experience (easy to over-soak)
❌ First germination (towel better)

## What You Need

☐ **Clear glass**
  - To see process
  - Volume: 3-7 oz (100-200ml)

☐ **Water**
  - Settled 24 hours
  - Room temperature (72-75°F / 22-24°C)
  - pH 6.0-6.5 (optional)

☐ **Warm dark place**
  - Temperature: 72-77°F (22-25°C)
  - No light (cover glass)

☐ **Tweezers** (for extraction)

## Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Prepare Water
- Settled 24 hours (chlorine evaporates)
- Temperature: 72-75°F (22-24°C)
- pH 6.0-6.5 if have meter

### Step 2: Fill Glass
- Pour 3-5 oz (100-150ml) water
- Not more — seed should sink

### Step 3: Drop Seeds
- Gently place seeds in water
- Will float on surface — normal
- Max 5 seeds per glass

### Step 4: Cover Glass
- With saucer or lid
- Darkness important for root
- But leave small gap for air

### Step 5: Place in Warm Spot
- 72-77°F (22-25°C)
- Cabinet, top of fridge
- Not in sun!

### Step 6: Observe

**After 6-12 hours:**
- Seeds should sink (good sign!)
- If floating — tap glass gently
- Still floating after 24h — normal for old seeds

**After 24-48 hours:**
- White taproot appears
- Shell opens
- Ready to transplant!

### Step 7: Transplant

**When:**
- Taproot 0.5-1cm (0.2-0.4 inches)
- Or right after shell opens

**How:**
1. Extract with tweezers (hold seed, not root)
2. Can transplant to soil
3. Or transfer to moist towel for 1-2 days (for control)

## Important Rules

### ⚠️ Don't Keep in Water &gt;48 Hours!

**Why:**
- Roots need oxygen
- Little oxygen in water
- After 48 hours seed suffocates

**What if taproot didn't appear in 48 hours:**
1. Transfer seed to moist towel
2. Continue germination there
3. Or plant directly in soil

## Transplanting to Soil

### Option 1: Direct to Soil (Recommended)

1. Pot with light moist soil
2. Hole 0.5-1 inch (1-1.5cm)
3. Taproot down
4. Cover with soil
5. Mist from spray bottle
6. Cover with cup (dome)

### Option 2: Towel First

**If want control:**
1. Transfer to moist paper towel
2. Wait until taproot grows to 0.5-1 inch (1-2cm)
3. Then transplant to soil

## Method Modifications

### For Old Seeds (>3gt;3 years)

**1. Scarification before soaking**
- Rub between fine sandpaper sheets
- 5-10 seconds
- Damages shell → faster germination

**2. Peroxide soak**
- 3% hydrogen peroxide instead of water
- 12-24 hours
- Softens shell + disinfection
- After peroxide — regular water for 12 hours

**3. Warm water (77-81°F / 25-27°C)**
- For very old seeds
- Speeds up swelling
- But not hot! (>8gt;86°F / 30°C kills seed)

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Over-Soaking

**Problem:**
- Seed in water &gt;72 hours
- Taproot brown

**Solution:**
❌ Seed died
✅ Next time: extract after 48 hours maximum

### Mistake 2: Cold Water

**Problem:**
- Tap water (<6lt;68°F / 20°C)
- Germination doesn't start

**Solution:**
✅ Warm water to 72-75°F (22-24°C)
✅ Change to warm water

### Mistake 3: Too Deep Glass

**Problem:**
- Seed at bottom → hard to reach
- Damaged taproot with tweezers

**Solution:**
✅ Use wide shallow glass/saucer
✅ Or pour water into plate for extraction

### Mistake 4: Forgot About Seeds

**Problem:**
- Remembered after 5 days
- Taproot 2-3 inches or rotted

**Solution:**
✅ Set phone reminder!
✅ Check every 12 hours

## Comparison with Other Methods

| Parameter | Water Glass | Paper Towel | Direct Soil |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Speed** | 24-48h | 48-72h | 3-7 days |
| **Control** | Medium | High | Low |
| **Risk** | Medium | Low | Low |
| **For old seeds** | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Good | ❌ Poor |
| **For beginner** | ⚠️ With caution | ✅ Perfect | ✅ Good |

## FAQ

**Q: Seed didn't sink even after 24 hours — is it bad?**
A: Not necessarily. Old seeds may float longer. If after 48 hours didn't sink — transfer to towel.

**Q: Water cloudy — what to do?**
A: Change water immediately. Cloudiness = bacteria. Rinse seed and place in clean water or on towel.

**Q: Can I add germination stimulator to water?**
A: Yes! Increases germination rate.

**Q: Taproot appeared but seed hasn't opened — what to do?**
A: Transplant. Seed will open in soil.

## Growie's Tip

Water glass method is my choice for old seeds from stash. But important not to forget! Set timers for 24 and 48 hours. If taproot didn't appear in 48 hours — transfer to towel, don't wait longer. Record results in Growie: you'll understand which strains/seed ages respond better to this method!
