# Care After Germination: First Weeks of Life

![Seedling care](/images/guides/after-germination.jpg)

Seed germinated — excellent! But first 2-3 weeks of seedling life are critical. Young plant is fragile and requires special care. Let's cover all nuances.

## Development Stages After Germination

### Week 1: Seedling

**What Happens:**
- Day 1-3: seedling breaks soil
- Day 3-5: cotyledons open
- Day 5-7: first pair true leaves

**Characteristics:**
- Height: 1-2 inches (2-5cm)
- Roots: taproot + first laterals
- Nutrition: from cotyledons and light from soil

### Week 2-3: Early Vegetation

**What Happens:**
- 2-3 pairs true leaves
- Active root growth
- Beginning nutrient uptake

**Characteristics:**
- Height: 2-6 inches (5-15cm)
- Roots: branched
- Nutrition: actively from soil/nutrients

### Week 4+: Vegetation

**Transition to Normal Care:**
- 4-6 pairs leaves
- Strong roots
- Full nutrition

## Seedling Conditions

### Light

**Parameters:**
- **Schedule**: 18/6 (18 hours light, 6 dark)
- **Distance**: 16-20 inches (40-50cm) from LED
- **Power**: 100-150W for 1-2 plants

**Rules:**
✅ Turn on light AFTER germination (not before!)
✅ Gradually bring closer (start 20 inches, week later — 16 inches)
✅ Watch reaction:
  - Stretching → light farther or weaker
  - Leaves curling → light too close or strong

**Common Mistakes:**
❌ Light too far (>24 inches / 60cm) → stretching
❌ Light too close (<12 inches / 30cm) → burns
❌ 24/0 light → stress

### Temperature

**Optimal:**
- **Day**: 72-77°F (22-25°C)
- **Night**: 64-72°F (18-22°C)
- **Drop**: 5-9°F (3-5°C) (stimulates growth)

**Critical Values:**
- ❌ <64°F (18°C) → slowed growth
- ❌ >82°F (28°C) → stress, stretching

**How to Ensure:**
✅ Thermometer in tent (at plant level)
✅ Ventilation (temperature control)
✅ Heat mat under pots (if cold)

### Humidity

**Optimal:**
- **Week 1**: 65-75% (dome)
- **Week 2-3**: 60-70% (gradually lower)
- **Week 4+**: 50-60% (regular veg)

**How to Ensure:**
✅ First 5-7 days: dome (cup/wrap)
✅ Gradual dome removal:
  - Day 1-2: open 1-2 hours
  - Day 3-4: open 4-6 hours
  - Day 5-7: remove completely

✅ Humidifier (if air dry)
✅ Leaf misting 1-2 times daily (first week)

### Air Circulation

**Important:**
- Gentle air movement strengthens stem
- But not direct strong flow!

**How to Ensure:**
✅ Oscillating fan on low speed
✅ Aim to side (not directly at plants)
✅ Gentle leaf movement — perfect

❌ Strong flow → stem bends → stress
❌ No circulation → weak stem, mold risk

## Seedling Watering

### Main Rules

**Main Rule:** Better underwater than overwater!

**Need Watering Signs:**
✅ Top soil layer (0.5-1 inch / 1-2cm) dry
✅ Pot light when lifted
✅ Plant slightly drooped (but not much!)

**Overwatering Signs:**
❌ Soil constantly wet
❌ Leaves droopy, wilted
❌ Slow growth

### Watering Technique

**First 5-7 Days:**
- Misting from spray bottle
- Around plant, not on stem!
- 5-10 sprays 1-2 times daily

**Week 2-3:**
- Small portion watering
- 2-3 oz (50-100ml) per plant
- When top layer dry

**Week 4+:**
- Normal watering (10-20% pot volume)
- With slight runoff (10-15%)

### What to Use

**Water:**
- Settled 24 hours
- Room temperature (72-75°F / 22-24°C)
- pH 6.0-6.5 (must check!)

**Nutrients:**
- **Week 1**: NOTHING! Only water
- **Week 2**: 1/4 dose (if light soil)
- **Week 3**: 1/2 dose
- **Week 4+**: full dose (per instructions)

**Rule:**
✅ Start with minimum dose
✅ Watch reaction
✅ Gradually increase

## Seedling Nutrition

### First Week

**Add Nothing!**
- Cotyledons contain nutrient reserve
- Light soil (Light Mix) has weak nutrients
- Excess = burn

**Signs All Good:**
✅ Cotyledons green
✅ First leaves appearing
✅ Growth present

### Second Week

**Start Feeding:**
- If using Light Mix / coco
- 1/4 dose veg nutrients
- Once every 3-4 days

**If Using All-Mix / Supersoil:**
- Add nothing!
- Soil has enough nutrition for 3-4 weeks

### Third Week and Beyond

**Full Nutrition:**
- 1/2 - full dose
- Watch EC (0.8-1.2 for seedlings)
- Watch plant reaction

### Deficiency Signs

**Nitrogen (N):**
- Lower leaves yellowing
- Slow growth

**Phosphorus (P):**
- Leaves dark green with purple tint
- Slow root growth

**Potassium (K):**
- Leaf edges brown (burn)
- But rare in early age

### Excess Signs

**Nutrient burn (overfeeding):**
- Leaf tips brown, "burned"
- Leaves dark green (nitrogen)
- Curled leaves

**Solution:**
1. Flush soil with clean water (pH 6.0-6.5)
2. Wait 3-5 days
3. Resume feeding with 1/4 dose

## Seedling Transplanting

### When to Transplant

**From cup (0.5-1L) to medium pot (3-5L):**

**Ready Signs:**
✅ 3-4 pairs true leaves
✅ Roots visible in drain holes
✅ Height 4-6 inches (10-15cm)
✅ Age 2-3 weeks

**Don't Wait Too Long:**
- Roots will tangle
- Growth slows

**Autoflowers:**
- Plant immediately in final pot (2-3 gallons / 7-11L)
- They don't like transplant!

### Transplant Technique

**Step 1: Prepare new pot**
- 3-5L (3-5 quarts) for photoperiods
- Fill with soil 2/3
- Moisten soil

**Step 2: Extract plant**
- Day before transplant water plant
- Flip pot, holding stem between fingers
- Gently shake out root ball
- Roots should hold shape

**Step 3: Inspect roots**
- White, healthy — excellent!
- Brown — possible rot (but not critical)
- Tangled — gently untangle with fingers

**Step 4: Place in new pot**
- Hole = size of old root ball
- Ball top = soil level (or slightly below)
- Fill with soil around
- Lightly press (not hard!)

**Step 5: Water**
- Generous watering around ball
- Soil should contact ball
- Slight runoff (10-15%)

### Care After Transplant

**First 24-48 Hours:**
- Plant may "sad" — normal
- Don't feed
- Normal watering

**After 2-3 Days:**
- Growth resumes
- Resume normal care

## Common Seedling Problems

### Problem 1: Stretching

**Cause:**
- Light far/weak
- Light on before germination

**Solution:**
✅ Bring light closer to 16 inches (40cm)
✅ Add soil around stem

### Problem 2: Yellow Leaves

**Cotyledons yellowing:**
- ✅ Normal after 2-3 weeks
- They gave nutrients

**True leaves yellowing:**
- ❌ Nitrogen deficiency
- Start feeding (1/4 dose)

### Problem 3: Slow Growth

**Causes:**
- Cold (<68°F / 20°C)
- Overwatering (roots suffocating)
- Too small pot
- Nutrient deficiency

**Solution:**
- Check temperature (72-77°F / 22-25°C)
- Check watering (don't overwater!)
- Transplant to larger pot
- Start feeding

### Problem 4: Leaves Curling

**Up (taco):**
- Light too close/strong
- Too hot (>82°F / 28°C)

**Down:**
- Overwatering
- Nutrient excess

**Clawing:**
- Nitrogen excess

### Problem 5: Spots on Leaves

**Brown spots:**
- Calcium/magnesium deficiency
- Add CalMag

**Yellow spots between veins:**
- Iron/magnesium deficiency

**White spots:**
- Light burn
- Pests (check!)

## Daily Care Checklist

### Every Day

☐ Check soil moisture (water if needed)
☐ Inspect leaves (color, shape, spots)
☐ Check temperature (72-77°F / 22-25°C)
☐ Check humidity (60-70%)
☐ Ensure light at correct distance (16-20 inches / 40-50cm)
☐ Check for pests

### Every 3-5 Days

☐ Feeding (if needed)
☐ Check water pH
☐ Photo plant (track growth)

### Weekly

☐ Measure height (record progress)
☐ Assess transplant need
☐ Check roots through drain holes

## Seedling Diary

### What to Record in Growie

**Day 1 (germination):**
- Date
- Germination method
- Strain

**Weekly:**
- Plant height
- Leaf pairs count
- Problems (if any)
- Actions (feeding, transplant)

**Photos:**
- Day 1, 7, 14, 21
- Compare progress

## Growie's Tip

First 2-3 weeks are most important. Don't rush feeding, don't overwater, watch light distance. 80% seedling problems are from overwatering and wrong light distance. Buy thermometer and hygrometer for $10-15 — they'll pay off in plant health. Keep detailed diary in Growie: photos, height, actions — you'll see patterns and understand what works best for your conditions. Remember: patience! Don't try to speed up nature — let plant develop at its pace!
