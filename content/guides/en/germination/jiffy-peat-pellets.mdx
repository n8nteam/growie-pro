# Peat and Coco Pellets: Convenient Germination

![Germination pellets](/images/guides/jiffy-peat-pellets.jpg)

Germination pellets (peat and coco) are convenient modern methods. They combine direct planting advantages with process control, ideal for beginners.

## What Are Germination Pellets

**Construction:**
- Compressed material (peat or coco) in netting
- Dry size: 0.8-1.6 inches (2-4cm) diameter, 0.2-0.4 inches (0.5-1cm) height
- After soaking: 1.6-2.8 inches (4-7cm) height
- Ready medium for germination and early growth

## Pellet Types

### Peat Pellets (Jiffy-7, Peat)

**Composition:**
- Compressed sphagnum peat
- pH buffered to 5.5-6.5
- Contains starter nutrients

**Best for:**
✅ Soil growing
✅ Organic grows
✅ Photoperiod strains

### Coco Pellets (Coco Coir)

**Composition:**
- Compressed coconut fiber
- Inert material (no nutrients)
- Stable pH 5.5-6.5

**Best for:**
✅ Hydroponics
✅ Coco coir substrate
✅ Autoflowers
✅ Precise nutrient control

### Compost Pellets (Root Riot)

**Composition:**
- Compost mix
- Organic + peat

**Best for:**
✅ Organic grows
✅ Cloning

## Comparison: Peat vs Coco

| Parameter | Peat Pellets | Coco Pellets |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **pH Stability** | Good (5.5-6.5) | Excellent (5.5-6.5) |
| **Nutrients** | Has starter | None (inert) |
| **Water Retention** | High | Medium |
| **Aeration** | Medium | Excellent |
| **Price** | $0.30-0.50 | $0.50-0.80 |
| **For Soil** | ✅ Ideal | ✅ Good |
| **For Hydro** | ⚠️ Possible | ✅ Ideal |
| **For Coco** | ⚠️ Possible | ✅ Ideal |
| **Eco-Friendly** | ⚠️ Peat non-renewable | ✅ Coco renewable |
| **Biodegradable** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

## When to Use Peat

✅ Growing in soil (Light Mix, All-Mix)
✅ Organic grow
✅ Want starter nutrients in pellet
✅ Budget option

## When to Use Coco

✅ Hydroponics (DWC, NFT, aeroponics)
✅ Growing in coco coir substrate
✅ Want full nutrient control (no starter nutrients)
✅ Autoflowers (coco = less transplant stress)
✅ Eco-friendliness matters (coco is renewable)

## Advantages and Disadvantages

- Less rot risk

### Cons ❌

**1. Cost**
- $0.50-1.00 per pellet
- More expensive than regular soil

**2. Limited Size**
- Need transplant in 2-3 weeks
- Can't grow long

**3. Availability**
- Not sold everywhere
- Need to order in advance

**4. Drying Out**
- Dry quickly (small volume)
- Need daily monitoring

## Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Soak Pellets

**1. Prepare warm water**
- Temperature: 72-77°F (22-25°C)
- pH 6.0-6.5 (if have meter)

**2. Place pellets in container**
- Dry side up (indentation on top)
- Distance 1-2 inches (3-5cm) between pellets

**3. Pour water**
- 2-3 oz (50-100ml) per pellet
- Water should cover bottom of pellet

**4. Wait for swelling**
- In 3-5 minutes pellet grows 5-7×
- Height: 1.6-2.8 inches (4-7cm)

**5. Squeeze excess water**
- Light hand squeeze
- Should be damp, not soaking
- No water dripping when squeezed

### Step 2: Prepare Hole

**Center indentation exists:**
- If shallow (0.2 inches / 0.5cm) — deepen to 0.5-1 inch (1-1.5cm)
- Use toothpick or pencil
- Don't poke through!

### Step 3: Place Seed

**1. Take seed**
- With tweezers or fingers
- Don't crush!

**2. Place in hole**
- Taproot down (if already sprouted)
- Or sideways
- Depth: 0.5-1 inch (1-1.5cm)

**3. Cover with peat**
- Pinch of peat on top
- Or gently close hole
- Don't compact!

### Step 4: Create Dome

**1. Place in container**
- All seeded pellets in one container
- Bit of water on bottom (0.2-0.4 inches / 0.5-1cm)

**2. Cover with lid**
- Clear lid/wrap
- Leave small holes for air
- Or ventilate twice daily for 10 minutes

### Step 5: Germination Conditions

**Temperature:**
- 72-77°F (22-25°C)
- Use heat mat under container (optional)

**Light:**
- Before germination: not needed (darkness)
- After germination: LED 18/6, 16-20 inches (40-50cm)

**Humidity:**
- 65-75%
- Dome maintains automatically

### Step 6: Daily Care

**Daily:**
- Check pellet moisture
- Dark color = moist
- Light color = needs water

**Watering:**
- Mist top from spray bottle
- Or add water to tray (0.2 inches / 0.5cm)
- Pellet absorbs from bottom

**Ventilation:**
- Twice daily for 10-15 minutes
- Removes condensation
- Prevents mold

## Transplanting to Soil

### When to Transplant

**Ready Signs:**
- Roots visible through netting
- 2-3 pairs true leaves
- Usually: 10-14 days after germination
- Plant height: 2-4 inches (5-10cm)

**Don't Wait Too Long:**
- Roots will tangle
- Plant slows growth
- Transplant becomes harder

### Transplant Process

**Step 1: Prepare pot**
- 1-3L (1-3 quarts) for start (or final for autos)
- Fill with soil 2/3
- Moisten soil

**Step 2: Make hole**
- Depth: slightly more than pellet height
- Diameter: pellet size + 0.5-1 inch (1-2cm)

**Step 3: Place pellet**
- **DON'T remove netting!**
- It's biodegradable, roots grow through
- Place whole pellet in hole
- Pellet top = soil level (or slightly below)

**Step 4: Fill with soil**
- Gently fill space around
- Lightly press (not hard!)
- Stem should be stable

**Step 5: Water**
- Generous watering around pellet
- Soil should contact pellet
- Don't pour directly on stem!

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Too Much Water When Soaking

**Problem:**
- Pellet floating in water
- Too wet, water dripping

**Solution:**
✅ Squeeze excess water
✅ Damp, not soaking

### Mistake 2: Removed Netting at Transplant

**Problem:**
- Beginner thinks netting interferes
- Removes at transplant

**Solution:**
✅ DON'T remove netting!
✅ It's biodegradable
✅ Roots grow through it

### Mistake 3: Grew Too Long in Pellet

**Problem:**
- Plant 4-5 weeks in pellet
- Roots tangled, grew out of pellet

**Solution:**
✅ Transplant 10-14 days after germination
✅ Maximum 3 weeks in pellet

### Mistake 4: Pellet Dried Out

**Problem:**
- Forgot to water
- Pellet hardened, light color

**Solution:**
✅ Check daily!
✅ Pellet color — moisture indicator

## Coco Pellet Specifics

### For Hydroponics and Coco

**Use coco instead of peat:**
- They're inert (no nutrients)
- Perfect for hydroponics and coco substrate
- Stable pH 5.5-6.5

**Feeding from Day One:**
- Coco contains no nutrition
- Start feeding at 1/4 dose right after germination
- Use CalMag (coco doesn't retain calcium/magnesium)

**Transplanting:**
- To coco coir substrate or hydro system
- Roots adapt quickly (coco → coco)
- Less stress than peat → coco

**Advantages for Autoflowers:**
- Coco = less stress with any manipulations
- Faster root development
- Better nutrient control

## FAQ

**Q: Need to remove netting at transplant?**
A: No! Netting is biodegradable, roots grow through it.

**Q: Peat or coco — which to choose?**
A: Peat — if growing in soil. Coco — if in hydroponics or coco substrate. For soil beginner — peat is easier.

**Q: Can I use coco pellets for soil grow?**
A: Yes, but you'll need to feed from first days (coco is inert). Peat is more convenient for soil.

**Q: Pellet covered with mold — what to do?**
A: Remove mold, improve ventilation, water less. If mold inside pellet — better transplant plant.

**Q: Can pellets be reused?**
A: No, they're single-use.

**Q: What pellet size is best?**
A: 1.5-1.75 inches (40-44mm) diameter — optimal. Smaller (1-1.4 inches / 25-35mm) — transplant sooner, larger (2+ inches / 50+mm) — more expensive.

**Q: Coco pellets cost more — are they worth it?**
A: If growing in hydro or coco — definitely yes. For soil, peat is cheaper and more convenient.

## Growie's Tip

Pellets are my choice for germinating multiple seeds. **Peat** for soil grows (BioBizz, Plagron), **coco** for hydroponics and coco substrate. Main thing — don't forget to water (they dry fast) and transplant on time (10-14 days). If unsure — get peat, they're more universal for beginners. Record in Growie pellet type, planting date, and results — you'll understand what works best for your system!
