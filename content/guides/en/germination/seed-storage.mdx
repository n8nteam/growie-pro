# Proper Cannabis Seed Storage

![Seed storage](/images/guides/seed-storage.jpg)

Proper seed storage ensures high germination rate even years later. Cannabis seeds can store 5-10 years with proper conditions. Let's learn how to do it right.

## Seed Shelf Life

### Germination Rate by Age

| Age | Germination with Proper Storage | With Improper |
|-----|--------------------------------|---------------|
| 0-6 months | 98-100% | 95-100% |
| 6-12 months | 95-98% | 85-95% |
| 1-2 years | 90-95% | 70-85% |
| 2-3 years | 85-90% | 50-70% |
| 3-5 years | 70-85% | 30-50% |
| 5-10 years | 50-70% | 10-30% |
| &gt;10 years | 20-50% | &lt;10% |

**Conclusion:** Proper storage extends seed life 2-3×!

### Aging Factors

**What Kills Seeds:**
1. **Moisture** — triggers germination → rot
2. **Heat** — speeds metabolism → aging
3. **Light** — destroys DNA → mutations
4. **Oxygen** — oxidation → loss of viability

**Ideal Conditions:**
- Darkness
- Cold (but not freezing)
- Dryness
- Sealed container

## Proper Storage: 3 Rules

### Rule 1: Darkness

**Why Important:**
- Light destroys genetic material
- UV rays damage shell
- Activates germination processes

**How to Ensure:**
✅ Opaque container (black, metal)
✅ Dark place (closet, drawer)
✅ Original foil packaging

### Rule 2: Cold

**Optimal Temperature: 41-50°F (5-10°C)**

**Options:**
✅ Bottom fridge shelf (vegetable drawer)
✅ Cellar (if temperature stable)
✅ Cool dark place (storage room in winter)

**Avoid:**
❌ Freezer (ice crystals damage cells)
❌ Room temperature &gt;68°F (20°C) (accelerated aging)
❌ Temperature fluctuations

### Rule 3: Dryness

**Optimal Humidity: 20-30%**

**How to Ensure:**
✅ Sealed container
✅ Silica gel inside (moisture absorber)
✅ Rice in separate packet

**Avoid:**
❌ Humidity &gt;40% (germination/mold risk)
❌ Direct contact with moisture absorber

## Ideal Packaging

### Option 1: Glass Jar (Best)

**What You Need:**
- Glass jar with sealed lid
- Dark glass or wrapped in foil
- Silica gel (1-2 packets)
- Label (strain, date)

**Instructions:**
1. Place silica gel packet on bottom
2. Seeds in original packaging (or packet with label)
3. Seal tightly
4. Label jar (strain, date, quantity)
5. To fridge (vegetable drawer)

**Pros:**
✅ Hermetic seal
✅ See contents
✅ Long storage life

### Option 2: Plastic Container

**What You Need:**
- Opaque plastic container with lid
- Silica gel
- Foil (wrap inside)

**Instructions:**
- Similar to glass jar
- Wrap inside with foil (light protection)

**Pros:**
✅ Lightweight
✅ Won't break

**Cons:**
❌ Less airtight than glass
❌ May let smell through

### Option 3: Vacuum Pack

**For Long Storage (5+ years):**
1. Seeds in paper packet (label!)
2. In vacuum bag with silica gel
3. Vacuum seal
4. To fridge freezer (not deep freeze!)

**Pros:**
✅ Maximum airtightness
✅ No oxygen = no oxidation
✅ Storage life 10+ years

**Cons:**
❌ Need vacuum sealer
❌ Hard to get few seeds (break vacuum)

## Step-by-Step Storage

### Step 1: Prepare Seeds

**Check:**
- Seeds dry (not moist)
- No damage
- Labeled (strain, date, quantity)

**Label:**
- Write on packet:
  - Strain/genetics
  - Purchase date
  - Seed quantity
  - Breeder (producer)

### Step 2: Pack

1. **Seeds in packet**
   - Paper or plastic zip-lock
   - With label!

2. **Add silica gel**
   - 1-2 packets per container
   - Shouldn't touch seeds directly

3. **In container**
   - Glass jar or plastic container
   - Seal tightly

### Step 3: Find Location

**Best Place: Fridge Vegetable Drawer**
- Temperature: 41-50°F (5-10°C)
- Stable
- Dark
- Humidity controlled

**Alternatives:**
- Cellar (if temperature stable)
- Cool storage room (in winter)

**Avoid:**
- Freezer (except vacuum packs)
- Bathroom (humidity)
- Window (light, temperature swings)
- Hot places (radiator, top of fridge)

### Step 4: Periodic Check

**Every 3-6 months:**
- Open container
- Check seed condition (dry? mold?)
- Check silica gel (if pink/wet — replace)
- Label check date

## Using Silica Gel

### What It Is

**Silica gel** — moisture absorber (desiccant).

**Types:**
- **Blue → pink** (indicator: blue = dry, pink = saturated)
- **White** (no indicator, cheaper)

### How to Use

**1. Quantity:**
- 1-2 packets (5-10g / 0.2-0.4 oz) per 7-17 oz (200-500ml) container
- More better than less

**2. Placement:**
- On container bottom
- Shouldn't touch seeds directly
- Can wrap in paper/cloth

**3. Replacement:**
- Every 6-12 months
- Or when indicator changes color

**4. Regeneration:**
- Saturated silica gel can be dried
- In oven 250°F (120°C) 1-2 hours
- Or in sun several days

### Alternative: Rice

**Raw rice:**
- Absorbs moisture
- Cheaper than silica gel
- But less effective

**How:**
- 2-3 tablespoons in separate packet
- On container bottom

## Common Storage Mistakes

### Mistake 1: In Freezer Without Vacuum

**Problem:**
- Seeds in freezer in regular packet
- Condensation when removing

**Solution:**
✅ Fridge (not freezer!)
✅ Or vacuum pack in freezer

### Mistake 2: In Humid Place

**Problem:**
- Storage in bathroom
- Or damp basement

**Solution:**
✅ Dry place
✅ Silica gel in container

### Mistake 3: In Light

**Problem:**
- Clear container
- On windowsill or lit shelf

**Solution:**
✅ Opaque container
✅ Dark place

### Mistake 4: Frequent Opening

**Problem:**
- Open container weekly to "check"
- Temperature and humidity fluctuations

**Solution:**
✅ Open once every 3-6 months
✅ When removing — quick, don't warm in hands

### Mistake 5: No Label

**Problem:**
- Forgot what strain
- Forgot when bought

**Solution:**
✅ Always label!
✅ Strain, date, quantity, breeder

## Checking Old Seed Viability

### Visual Inspection

**Good Seeds:**
✅ Hard to touch
✅ Dark color (brown, gray)
✅ Waxy shell
✅ Tiger pattern (spots)

**Bad Seeds:**
❌ Soft, squish
❌ Green (immature)
❌ Cracked
❌ White (very old)

### Float Test

**Instructions:**
1. Glass of room temperature water
2. Drop seed in
3. Wait 2-3 hours

**Result:**
- **Sank** → likely viable (95%)
- **Floating** → may be old (but not necessarily dead)

**Important:**
- Not 100% accurate test
- Old seeds may float but germinate
- After test immediately germinate or dry back

## Growie's Tip

Seeds are valuable resource, especially rare genetics. Don't spare $5 on good glass jar and silica gel — it extends your collection's life for years. I store seeds in fridge in jars, each labeled with date. Check silica gel every 6 months. Over 5 years storage, germination hasn't dropped below 85%! Keep track in Growie: record when bought, when checked, when used — you won't lose control of collection!
