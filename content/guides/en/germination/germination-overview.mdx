# Cannabis Seed Germination: Complete Guide

![Seed germination](/images/guides/germination-overview.jpg)

Germination is the first and most critical stage of growing. Proper start determines plant health throughout all stages. Let's cover all methods and learn to do it right.

## What is Germination

**Germination** — process of seed awakening and first root (taproot) emergence.

### What Happens Inside the Seed

1. **Moisture absorption** — shell swells
2. **Hormone activation** — growth initiates
3. **Shell opening** — white root appears
4. **Taproot growth** — root seeks soil
5. **Cotyledon emergence** — first round leaves

### Timeline

- **Fast seeds**: 24-48 hours
- **Average**: 2-5 days
- **Old/weak**: 5-10 days
- **Won't germinate**: >10 days

## Conditions for Successful Germination

### 1. Temperature
**Optimal**: 72-77°F (22-25°C)
- Below 68°F (20°C) — slows down
- Above 82°F (28°C) — risk of death

**Solution**: warm location (top of fridge, heating pad with spacer)

### 2. Moisture
**Optimal**: constant moisture, not soaked
- Seed must be moist but breathe
- Over-saturation = rot

### 3. Darkness
Root grows in darkness — cover seeds!

### 4. Oxygen
Roots need air — don't fully submerge in water

### 5. pH
**Optimal**: 6.0-6.5
- Too high/low pH slows process

## Method Comparison

| Method | Speed | Difficulty | Risk | Success Rate |
|--------|-------|------------|------|--------------|
| **Paper Towel** | 24-72h | Very Low | Low | 95% |
| **Water Glass** | 24-48h | Very Low | Medium | 90% |
| **Direct Soil** | 3-7 days | Low | Low | 85% |
| **Peat Pellets** | 2-5 days | Low | Low | 90% |
| **Rockwool** | 2-4 days | Medium | Medium | 85% |

## Method 1: Paper Towel (Recommended!)

### Why Best Method
✅ See germination moment
✅ Control moisture
✅ Minimal equipment
✅ High success rate

### What You Need
- 2 paper towels
- 2 plates (or container with lid)
- Spray bottle with water
- Warm dark place

### Step-by-Step

**Day 1:**
1. Moisten paper towel (damp, not soaking)
2. Place on plate
3. Place seeds 1-1.5 inches apart
4. Cover with second moist towel
5. Cover with second plate (container lid)
6. Place in warm dark spot

**Day 2-3:**
- Check twice daily
- Maintain moisture (don't let dry)
- Don't touch seeds!

**Day 3-5:**
- Taproot 0.5-1cm = ready to plant
- Don't wait until >2cm!

## Method 2: Water Glass

### When to Use
- Old seeds (>2 years)
- Hard shell
- Need quick start

### Instructions
1. Glass of warm water (72-75°F / 22-24°C)
2. Drop seeds in
3. After 12-24 hours they'll sink (good sign)
4. After 24-48 hours taproot appears
5. Transfer to soil/towel

**⚠️ Important**: don't keep in water >48 hours — will suffocate!

## Method 3: Direct to Soil

### Pros
✅ Minimal stress
✅ Natural method
✅ No transplant needed

### Instructions
1. Pot with light soil (Light Mix)
2. Moisten soil
3. Hole 0.5-1 inch deep
4. Seed taproot down (or sideways)
5. Cover with soil
6. Cover with clear cup (dome)
7. Wait 3-7 days

## Method 4: Peat Pellets (Jiffy)

### Instructions
1. Soak pellet in warm water
2. Squeeze excess water
3. Make 0.5 inch hole
4. Place seed
5. Cover with clear dome
6. Wait 2-5 days

## After Germination

### If Method: Paper Towel or Water Glass
1. **Prepare pot** with moist light soil
2. **Hole 0.5 inch** deep
3. **Place seed taproot down**
4. **Gently cover** with soil (don't compact!)
5. **Mist** with spray bottle
6. **Cover with clear cup** (dome)
7. **Light 18/6** at 16-20 inches distance
8. **Temperature 72-77°F**, humidity 65-75%

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Too Deep Planting
❌ 1-1.5 inches depth → seedling can't emerge
✅ 0.5-1 inch — perfect

### Mistake 2: Cold Water/Room
❌ <68°F → slow germination/death
✅ 72-77°F — comfort

### Mistake 3: Overwatering
❌ Seed floating in water >48 hours → rot
✅ Moist but breathing

### Mistake 4: Panic and Digging
❌ Check daily, dig up seed
✅ Patience! Wait 7 days before concern

### Mistake 5: Direct Sunlight
❌ Seedling in sun → overheating → death
✅ Gentle light, 16-20 inches from LED

## Seed Storage

Proper storage = high germination rate.

**Conditions**:
- **Temperature**: 41-50°F (5-10°C) (fridge, not freezer)
- **Humidity**: low (sealed container with rice)
- **Darkness**: opaque packaging
- **Duration**: up to 5 years with proper storage

## Germination Rate by Age

| Age | Germination Rate |
|-----|-----------------|
| 0-1 year | 95-100% |
| 1-2 years | 85-95% |
| 2-3 years | 70-85% |
| 3-5 years | 50-70% |
| >5 years | <50% |

## Growie's Tip

For first grow, I recommend the **paper towel method** — it gives maximum control and lets you see germination moment. Don't rush to plant seed with 2-inch taproot — optimal is 0.5-1 inch. Keep diary in Growie: record method, start date, temperature — you'll understand what works best for your conditions!
