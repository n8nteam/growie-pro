# Paper Towel Method: Step-by-Step Guide

![Paper towel method](/images/guides/paper-towel-method.jpg)

Paper towel method is the gold standard for cannabis seed germination. It provides maximum control, high germination rate (95%+), and lets you watch the process in real time.

## Why This Method is Best

### Advantages ✅

**1. Process Visibility**
- See shell opening moment
- Track taproot growth
- Notice problems immediately

**2. Condition Control**
- Easy to maintain moisture
- Stable temperature
- Oxygen accessible

**3. High Success Rate**
- 95-98% for fresh seeds
- 80-90% for old (>2 years)

**4. Simplicity**
- Only need towels and plates
- No experience required
- Hard to mess up

## What to Prepare

### Required

☐ **2 paper towels**
  - White, no pattern
  - Quality (won't fall apart)
  - Alternative: cotton pads

☐ **2 plates**
  - One — base
  - Second — lid
  - Alternative: plastic container with lid

☐ **Water**
  - Settled 24 hours
  - Room temperature (72-75°F / 22-24°C)
  - pH 6.0-6.5 (optional but better)

☐ **Spray bottle**
  - For moistening towel
  - Gentle misting

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Day 1: Setup and Launch

**Step 1: Prepare water**
- Settled water 24 hours
- Room temperature (72-75°F / 22-24°C)
- If have pH meter: adjust to 6.0-6.5

**Step 2: Moisten first towel**
- Spray generously
- Should be damp, not soaking
- Test: no water drips when squeezed

**Step 3: Place towel on plate**
- Spread evenly
- Ensure plate is clean

**Step 4: Place seeds**
- Spacing: 1-1.5 inches between seeds
- Max 5 seeds per towel
- Seeds shouldn't touch

**Step 5: Cover with second towel**
- Moisten same way
- Gently cover seeds
- Don't move seeds!

**Step 6: Cover with plate**
- Second plate becomes lid
- Or plastic container lid
- Must be dark

**Step 7: Find warm spot**
- Temperature: 72-77°F (22-25°C)
- Dark place (inside closet, under bed)
- Options: top of fridge, near radiator (not on it!)

### Day 2-3: Observation

**Morning:**
- Open plate
- Check towel moisture
- If drying — spray
- Don't touch seeds!
- Close back

**Evening:**
- Repeat check
- Temperature should be stable

**What happens:**
- Day 1: seeds swell
- Day 2: shell starts opening
- Day 3: white taproot appears

### Day 3-5: Germination

**Ready signs:**
✅ Taproot white and strong
✅ Length 0.5-1cm (0.2-0.4 inches)
✅ Growing straight (not bent)

**When to transplant:**
- **Ideal**: taproot 0.5-1cm (0.2-0.4 inches)
- **Acceptable**: up to 2cm (0.8 inches)
- **Too long**: >3cm (>1.2 inches) (risk of breaking)

## Transplanting to Soil

### Preparation

**Step 1: Prepare pot**
- 0.5-1L (1-2 pint) pot
- Light soil (Light Mix, Seed Starter)
- Moisten soil (damp, not wet)

**Step 2: Make hole**
- Depth: 0.5-1 inch (1-1.5cm)
- Use pencil or finger
- No deeper!

### Transplant Process

**Step 3: Extract seed**
- **Important**: don't touch taproot!
- Use tweezers (hold seed, not root)
- Or gently roll onto spoon

**Step 4: Place in hole**
- Taproot down
- If taproot bent — sideways
- Don't bury deeper than 1 inch

**Step 5: Cover with soil**
- Gently cover
- Don't compact!
- Soil should be loose

**Step 6: Moisten**
- Light misting from spray bottle
- Don't pour water directly!

**Step 7: Create dome**
- Cover with clear cup
- Or use plastic bottle (cut)
- Maintains humidity

## Common Mistakes and Solutions

### Mistake 1: Too Wet Towel

**Problem:**
- Water drips when tilted
- Seeds floating

**Solution:**
✅ Squeeze excess water
✅ Damp, not soaking

### Mistake 2: Drying Out

**Problem:**
- Towel dry
- Forgot to check

**Solution:**
✅ Check twice daily
✅ Spray when needed

### Mistake 3: Waited Too Long

**Problem:**
- Taproot >2 inches (5cm)
- Grown into towel

**Solution:**
✅ Transplant at 0.5-1 inch (1-2cm)
✅ If grown in — moisten towel, carefully separate

### Mistake 4: Cold Location

**Problem:**
- Temperature <68°F (20°C)
- Slow germination

**Solution:**
✅ Warm spot (72-77°F / 22-25°C)
✅ Top of fridge, near radiator (but not on it!)

### Mistake 5: Opening Too Often

**Problem:**
- Open every 2 hours
- Touch seeds

**Solution:**
✅ Check twice daily (morning, evening)
✅ Don't touch seeds!

## Advanced Techniques

### For Old Seeds (>2 years)

**1. Scarification before soaking**
- Lightly damage shell with sandpaper
- Helps water penetrate faster

**2. Peroxide soak**
- 3% hydrogen peroxide
- 15-20 minutes
- Disinfection + shell softening

**3. Germination stimulator**
- Add to water for moistening towel
- Increases germination 15-20%

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use toilet paper?**
A: Yes, but quality (non-dissolving). Paper towels better.

**Q: Seed germinated but taproot growing up, not down?**
A: Normal at initial stage. When planting, taproot will go down (geotropism).

**Q: Taproot grown into towel, what to do?**
A: Moisten area heavily, wait 5 minutes, carefully separate with tweezers.

**Q: How many seeds can germinate on one towel?**
A: Up to 5-6 pieces with 1-1.5 inch spacing.

## Growie's Tip

Paper towel method is my favorite for beginners. Main rule: don't rush! Seed with 0.5-inch taproot will transplant better than one with 2 inches. Keep diary in Growie: record start date, method, temperature, and germination time — you'll understand patterns in your conditions. Remember: patience is rewarded!
