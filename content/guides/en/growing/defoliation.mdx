# Defoliation: Removing Leaves for Yield

![Defoliation](/images/guides/defoliation.jpg)

Defoliation is strategic removal of leaves to improve circulation, light, and yield. Proper defoliation increases yield 20-40%, improper — kills plant!

## What is Defoliation?

**Defoliation** is removing healthy fan leaves for:
- Improving light penetration to lower buds
- Enhancing air circulation (mold prevention)
- Redirecting energy to buds

**Important:** This is NOT removing dead leaves! This is removing healthy leaves.

## Why Defoliate?

### Problem

**Without defoliation:**
- Upper leaves block light
- Lower buds small ("popcorn")
- Poor circulation → mold risk
- 70% yield from tops, 30% from bottom

### With Defoliation

**After defoliation:**
- Light penetrates to all buds
- Lower buds grow bigger
- Excellent circulation
- 85% yield quality

## Pros and Cons

### Pros ✅

- **More light:** Lower buds receive light
- **More circulation:** Less mold risk
- **More energy to buds:** Instead of leaves
- **Better quality:** All buds dense

### Cons ❌

- **Stress:** Plant loses photosynthesis
- **Risk:** Easy to overdo → plant dies
- **Recovery:** 3-7 days stress
- **Complexity:** Need experience

## When to Defoliate?

### Defoliation Schedule

| Stage | When | How Much to Remove |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| **Veg** | Week 4-6 | 20-30% leaves (lower tiers) |
| **Before 12/12** | 1-3 days before switch | 30-40% (everything under screen) |
| **Flowering** | Day 1 or week 1 | 20-30% (blocking light) |
| **Flowering** | Week 3 | 20-30% (repeat) |
| **Late flowering** | Week 6+ | DON'T TOUCH! |

### Veg: Optional

**When:** Week 4-6
**How much:** 20-30%
**What to remove:**
- Lower tier leaves (not getting light)
- Large leaves shading side branches

**Goal:** Improve circulation, direct energy to upper branches

---

### Before Flowering: Recommended

**When:** 1-3 days before switching 12/12
**How much:** 30-40%
**What to remove:**
- Everything under SCROG screen (if using)
- Lower 1-2 branch tiers

**Goal:** Plant doesn't waste energy on lower branches

---

### Flowering Week 1: Must!

**When:** Day 1-7 after switching 12/12
**How much:** 20-30%
**What to remove:**
- Leaves inside dense canopy
- Leaves completely blocking buds
- Leaves touching neighboring plants

**Goal:** Mold prevention, light on buds

---

### Flowering Week 3: Repeat (Schwazzing)

**When:** Week 3 of flowering
**How much:** 20-30%
**What to remove:**
- Leaves grown after first defoliation
- Leaves blocking buds

**Goal:** Last time improve light before bud swelling

---

### Late Flowering (Week 6+): DON'T TOUCH!

**Why:**
- Plant won't have time to recover
- Stress will reduce yield
- Leaves needed for photosynthesis and ripening

## Schwazzing Technique

**Schwazzing** is aggressive defoliation twice during flowering (day 1 and week 3).

### Three A Light Method

**Author:** Joshua Haupt (book "Three A Light")

**Process:**
1. **Flowering day 1:**
   - Remove 100% of leaves (leave only buds!)
   - Yes, completely bare plant

2. **Flowering week 3:**
   - Remove all new leaves (again 100%)

3. **Result:**
   - Yield up to 3 pounds (1.36 kg) per light

**Important:**
⚠️ This is for EXPERTS!
⚠️ Requires perfect conditions
⚠️ Can kill plant if you mess up

**Our advice:** Start with moderate defoliation, not Schwazzing!

## What to Remove: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Determine Goal

**Questions:**
- Want more light? → Remove blocking leaves
- Want circulation? → Remove center/lower
- Want redirect energy? → Remove lower tiers

### Step 2: Choose Leaves

**Remove:**
✅ Large fan leaves blocking buds
✅ Leaves inside dense canopy (no light)
✅ Lower leaves (don't get light, will yellow)
✅ Leaves touching neighboring plants
✅ Bent/deformed leaves

**DON'T remove:**
❌ Leaves on tops (needed for photosynthesis)
❌ Leaves sticking from buds (sugar leaves) — leave!
❌ More than 40% at once
❌ Small young leaves

### Step 3: Removal Technique

**Tools:**
- Clean scissors (treat with alcohol!)
- Or hands (better for veg)

**How:**
1. **Find petiole** (leaf stem)
2. **Cut/pinch** at petiole base
3. **Don't leave stumps** (will rot)

**Order:**
- Bottom to top
- Center outward

### Step 4: After Defoliation

**First 24 hours:**
- Don't water (if recently watered)
- Maintain conditions (72-79°F / 22-26°C, 50-60% RH)

**Days 2-7:**
- Plant recovering
- May slightly slow growth (normal)

## Lollipopping

**Lollipopping** is removing all lower branches and leaves, leaving only upper 30-40% of plant.

### Result

Plant looks like **lollipop:**
- Bare stem at bottom
- Fluffy top

### When to Do

**Flowering week 1 or 3 days before 12/12**

### Process

1. **Determine height:**
   - Leave upper 30-40% of plant
   - Or: everything above SCROG screen

2. **Remove everything below:**
   - All leaves
   - All small branches
   - All small buds

3. **Result:**
   - Energy goes only to upper buds
   - Excellent circulation at bottom

### Pros

✅ All buds large (no "popcorn")
✅ Easier to trim at harvest
✅ Less mold risk

## Defoliation for Different Methods

### LST + Defoliation

**When:** Week 1 and 3 of flowering
**What:** Leaves in center (where branches twist)
**Result:** +30-40% yield

---

### SCROG + Defoliation

**Must!**

**When:** Before 12/12 (1-3 days)
**What:** 100% under screen + lollipopping
**Result:** All energy to buds above screen

---

### SOG + Defoliation

**Minimal!**

**When:** Flowering week 1
**What:** Only lower 1-2 tiers (lollipopping)
**Result:** Better circulation with dense planting

## Defoliation Mistakes

### ❌ Too Aggressive (>50%)

**Problem:** Removed more than half leaves
**Result:** Plant in shock, may die

### ❌ Defoliation During Late Flowering

**Problem:** Week 6-8 of flowering
**Result:** Plant won't recover, yield decreases

### ❌ Defoliation of Sick Plant

**Problem:** Plant with deficiencies/diseases
**Result:** Will finish plant off

### ❌ Removing Sugar Leaves

**Problem:** Removed small leaves sticking from buds
**Result:** Smaller buds

### ❌ Frequent Defoliation

**Problem:** Every week
**Result:** Plant in constant stress

## Autos and Defoliation

**Can you?**
⚠️ Yes, but very carefully!

**Rules:**
- **Only light:** Maximum 10-15% leaves
- **Only once:** Week 3-4 (flowering start)
- **Or don't at all:** Better safe than sorry

**Why careful:**
Autos don't have time to recover → stress reduces yield.

## Growie's Advice

Defoliation is powerful tool, but start conservatively! First grow: remove only lower 1-2 tiers (lollipopping) on flowering week 1 — safe and gives +15-20% yield. Second grow: try two defoliations (week 1 and 3 by 20-30%) — classic approach with +30-40% yield. Leave Schwazzing for 4-5 grow when you gain experience. In Growie, photograph BEFORE and AFTER defoliation, log how many leaves removed, how plant recovered — you'll find your balance. And remember: better underdefoliate than overdefoliate — excess stress kills yield!
