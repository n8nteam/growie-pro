# LST (Low Stress Training): Complete Guide

![LST Training](/images/guides/lst-training.jpg)

LST (Low Stress Training) is the safest and most effective technique for beginners. Increases yield 30-50% without risk to plant. Works even for autos!

## What is LST?

**LST** is bending and tying branches to create even canopy.

**Principle:**
Main cola grows vertically and dominates (apical dominance). When you bend it horizontally, side branches start growing up and become equal to main cola.

**Result:**
- Instead of 1 big cola → 6-12 medium colas
- All colas receive light evenly
- Yield +30-50%

## LST Pros and Cons

### Pros ✅

- **Safe:** No plant damage
- **For autos:** Only HST technique for autos
- **Simple:** Learn in 5 minutes
- **Reversible:** Can untie and return
- **Gradual:** Do bit by bit every 2-3 days
- **Height control:** Plant doesn't stretch up

### Cons ❌

- **Requires time:** Tie every 2-3 days
- **Slower than HST:** Topping gives results faster
- **Need materials:** Wire, strings, hooks

## When to Start LST?

### Optimal Time

**Week 3-4 of veg:**
- Plant 6-8 inches (15-20 cm) tall
- Minimum 4-5 nodes (branch tiers)
- Stem flexible but not too thin

**Too early (week 1-2):**
❌ Stem too thin → may break

**Too late (week 7-8+):**
❌ Stem woody → hard to bend

### For Autos

**Week 2-3 (earlier than photos!):**
- Autos grow faster
- Start as soon as stem strengthens
- Stop 1-2 weeks before flowering

## What You Need for LST

### Materials

1. **Soft coated wire:**
   - $5-10 per roll
   - Green for plants (Garden Wire)
   - Soft, doesn't cut stems

2. **String/twine:**
   - $3-5
   - Natural (jute, cotton)

3. **Plant clips/LST clips:**
   - $5-10
   - Plastic, with soft ends

4. **Pot edge hooks:**
   - $10-15 (optional)
   - Or use pot holes

## Step-by-Step LST Instructions

### Step 1: First Bend (week 3-4)

1. **Choose moment:**
   - Morning or evening (plant more flexible)
   - After watering (stem flexes better)

2. **Bend main cola:**
   - Slowly lean top to side (90°)
   - Don't break! If you hear crunch — stop

3. **Secure:**
   - Wire around stem (not tight!)
   - Other end to pot edge
   - Top should be horizontal

**Important:** Don't bend at very base! Bend 2-4 inches (5-10 cm) below top.

### Step 2: Tying Side Branches (week 4-6)

**After 2-3 days:**
Side branches start reaching up.

**What to do:**
1. Bend and tie each side branch
2. Try to create even circle (all tops same height)
3. Main cola continues growing → tie again

**Frequency:**
Check every 2-3 days and tie new growth.

### Step 3: Maintenance (week 6-8)

**Goal:** Even canopy (all tops same height)

**How:**
- If branch grew higher → bend and tie
- If branch lower → untie a bit
- Create "bowl" or "spiral" shape

### Step 4: Switching to Flowering

**1 week before 12/12:**
- Do last ties
- Make sure canopy even

**After switch:**
- First 2-3 weeks flowering can still do light LST
- Then stop (branches woody)

## LST Shapes

### "Spiral" (most popular)

**How:**
- Bend main cola in circle (clockwise)
- Direct side branches outward

**Pros:**
- Maximum space use
- Even canopy

---

### "Bowl"

**How:**
- Main cola in center, bent slightly
- Side branches bent outward in circle

**Pros:**
- Good circulation in center
- Easier for beginners

---

### "Line"

**How:**
- Main cola bent one direction
- Side branches other direction

**Pros:**
- Works for narrow spaces
- Simple

## LST Mistakes

### ❌ Too sharp bend

**Problem:** Stem will break
**How to avoid:** Bend slowly, listen to plant

### ❌ Too tight wire

**Problem:** Wire cuts into stem → damage
**How to avoid:** Leave small gap, check every 3-4 days

### ❌ LST during late flowering

**Problem:** Branches woody, break
**How to avoid:** Stop LST by week 3-4 flowering

### ❌ Uneven canopy

**Problem:** Some branches higher, others lower
**How to avoid:** Check every 2-3 days, level height

## LST for Autos

### Specifics

**Start earlier:**
- Week 2-3 (as soon as stem strengthens)

**Be gentler:**
- Autos smaller, more delicate
- Don't bend too hard

**Stop earlier:**
- By week 4-5 (before flowering)
- Autos don't recover as fast

**Result:**
+30-40% yield (less than photos, but safe)

## LST + Other Techniques

### LST + Topping

**Process:**
1. Week 3: Topping → 2 colas
2. Week 4-8: LST both colas + side branches
3. Result: 8-12 even colas

**Yield:** +80-100%

---

### LST + Defoliation

**Process:**
1. Week 4-8: LST
2. Flowering week 1: Remove lower leaves (better circulation)
3. Result: More light on buds

**Yield:** +50-60%

## When to Remove Ties?

**Option 1:** Leave until harvest
- If ties not cutting into stems
- Easier

**Option 2:** Remove by mid-flowering (week 4-5)
- Branches already fixed in position
- Won't return vertical

## Growie's Advice

LST is best technique for first grow! Start simple: bend main cola and tie on week 3-4. After 2-3 days bend side branches. Repeat every 2-3 days until you get even circle. Don't be afraid to bend — cannabis very flexible during veg! In Growie, photograph plant every 2-3 days after tying — you'll see how shape changes and understand when to tie again. And remember: better underbend than break — if you feel resistance, stop!
