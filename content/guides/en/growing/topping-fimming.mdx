# Topping and FIM: Doubling Your Colas

![Topping and FIM](/images/guides/topping-fimming.jpg)

Topping and FIM are techniques for cutting the top to create multiple colas. One cut → 2-4 colas instead of one. Yield +40-70%!

## What is Topping?

**Topping** is cutting off plant top (main cola).

**Principle:**
When you cut the top, plant loses apical dominance. Two side branches under cut become new main colas.

**Result:**
- 1 cola → 2 colas
- Can repeat → 4 colas → 8 colas
- Yield +40-60%

## What is FIM?

**FIM** stands for "Fuck, I Missed" (accidental discovery!)

**Principle:**
Cut 75% of top (not completely). Plant tries to restore top and creates 3-5 new colas from one point.

**Result:**
- 1 cola → 3-5 colas
- More chaotic growth than topping
- Yield +50-70%

## Topping vs FIM Comparison

| Parameter | Topping | FIM |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| **Cut** | 100% of top | 75% of top |
| **New colas** | 2 (precisely) | 3-5 (unpredictable) |
| **Recovery** | 7-10 days | 5-7 days (faster!) |
| **Predictability** | High | Medium |
| **Difficulty** | Easy | Medium |
| **Stress** | Medium | Low |
| **Best for** | Structure control | Maximum colas |

## When to Top/FIM?

### Optimal Time

**Week 3-5 of veg:**
- Minimum 4-6 nodes (branch tiers)
- Height 8-12 inches (20-30 cm)
- Plant healthy, growing fast

**Too early (week 1-2):**
❌ Plant too small → major stress

**Too late (week 7-8+):**
❌ Soon flowering → won't recover

**Autos:**
❌ DON'T top/FIM autos! They don't have time to recover → yield decrease.

### How Many Times?

**Topping:**
- 1 time: 2 colas
- 2 times: 4 colas (weeks 3 and 5)
- 3 times: 8 colas (weeks 3, 5, 7)

**Important:** Minimum 10-14 days between toppings!

**FIM:**
- 1 time: 3-5 colas
- Repeating harder (chaotic growth)

## Topping: Step-by-Step

### Preparation

**What you need:**
- Clean sharp scissors (treat with alcohol!)
- Plant: 4-6 nodes, healthy

**When:**
- Morning (plant in best condition)
- 1-2 days before watering (less sap)

### Step 1: Choose Cut Location

**Where to cut:**
- Above 3-4 node (branch tier)
- Leave 4-5 tiers at bottom

**Why not lower:**
- If cut above 1-2 node → few side branches

### Step 2: Make Cut

1. **Clean scissors:**
   - Cut top above chosen node
   - Cut clean, one motion

2. **Where exactly:**
   - 0.1-0.2 inch (3-5 mm) above node
   - Don't leave long "stump" (will rot)

### Step 3: After Cut

**First 24 hours:**
- Don't touch plant
- Don't water (if recently watered)

**After 2-3 days:**
- Two side branches under cut start growing vertically
- These are new main colas!

**After 7-10 days:**
- Plant fully recovered
- New colas actively growing

### Step 4: Repeat Topping (optional)

**After 10-14 days:**
If you want 4 colas, top each of two new colas.

**Result:** 2 colas → 4 colas

## FIM: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Preparation

**Same as topping:**
- Clean scissors
- Week 3-5 of veg

### Step 2: Make Cut

**Different from topping:**
- Cut only 75% of top (not all!)
- Leave lower 1/4 of new leaves

**How:**
1. Look at very top (new small leaves)
2. Cut upper 3/4 of these leaves
3. Leave lower 1/4

**Difficulty:** Need to feel it!

### Step 3: Recovery

**After 5-7 days:**
- 3-5 new colas grow from cut
- Growth chaotic (not symmetrical like topping)

**Important:** Sometimes only 2 colas (like topping) → normal, you just cut too much.

## Recovery After Topping/FIM

### First 3 Days

**What happens:**
- Plant in shock
- Growth slows
- May slightly droop

**What to do:**
✅ Don't water (if recently watered)
✅ Maintain optimal conditions (72-79°F / 22-26°C, 50-60% RH)
✅ Don't use other HST techniques!

### Days 4-7

**What happens:**
- Side branches start growing vertically
- Plant recovering

**What to do:**
✅ Normal watering and feeding
✅ Can start light LST (bending new colas)

### Days 7-14

**What happens:**
- Plant fully recovered
- New colas actively growing

**What to do:**
✅ Can repeat topping (if planning)
✅ Or switch to LST

## Growie's Advice

Topping is a must-have technique for photos! Start simple: one cut on week 3-4 above 4th node. Treat scissors with alcohol, cut clean and fast. In 7-10 days you'll see two new colas — it's magic! If you want more experiments, try FIM, but be ready for unpredictability. In Growie, log every topping: what day, above which node, how many days recovery — you'll find optimal timing for your conditions. And remember: minimum 10-14 days between each topping, otherwise plant in constant stress!
