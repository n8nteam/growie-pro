# Supercropping: Controlled Stem Breaking

![Supercropping](/images/guides/supercropping.jpg)

Supercropping is advanced HST technique of "controlled breaking" stem. You bend stem until crunch, it becomes thicker and stronger. Yield +30-50%!

## What is Supercropping?

**Supercropping** is technique of bending stem until damaging internal tissues (but not outer skin).

**Principle:**
Squeeze and bend stem until you hear/feel crunch. Stem breaks inside, but outer "skin" stays intact. Plant repairs damage, creating thicker and stronger stem (like bone callus after fracture).

**Result:**
- Stem becomes 50-100% thicker at break point
- Better nutrient transport → bigger buds
- Height control (bent branch lower)
- Yield +30-50%

## Pros and Cons

### Pros ✅

- **Thick stems:** 1.5-2x thicker at break point
- **Height control:** Bend tallest branches → even canopy
- **More yield:** +30-50% from better transport
- **Late veg weeks:** Can do when too late for topping

### Cons ❌

- **Stress:** Serious damage
- **Risk:** Can completely break stem
- **Recovery:** 7-14 days
- **NOT for autos!** Won't have time to recover
- **Complexity:** Need experience and courage

## When to Supercrop?

### Optimal Time

**Week 5-8 of veg or week 1-2 of flowering**

**Why this period:**
- Stems flexible but strong
- Enough time for recovery
- Can control height before stretch

**Too early (weeks 1-4):**
❌ Stems too thin → will break completely

**Too late (week 4+ flowering):**
❌ Stems woody, hard to bend
❌ Stress will reduce yield

### Autos

❌ **DON'T supercrop autos!**
They don't have time to recover → yield decreases.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Preparation

**What you need:**
- Hands (no tools needed!)
- Optional: wire/ties (if need to secure)
- Optional: tape (if accidentally break)

**Choose branches:**
- Tallest (for height control)
- Thickest (will become even thicker)
- Main colas or large side branches

**DON'T touch:**
- Thin branches (will break)
- Woody stems (won't bend)

### Step 1: Find Point

**Where to bend:**
- **4-6 inches (10-15 cm) below top** (not at very top!)
- On straight section of stem (not at node)

**Why not at top:**
Top may fall off → loss of cola.

### Step 2: Soften Stem

**Technique:**
1. **Pinch stem** between thumb and index finger
2. **Squeeze and roll** 10-20 seconds
3. Feel stem softening

**Goal:** Soften internal tissues without damaging skin.

### Step 3: Bend Stem

**Technique:**
1. **Slowly bend** stem at chosen point
2. **Wait for crunch** — you'll hear/feel crack inside
3. **Continue bending** to 45-90°

**Important:**
- Bend SLOWLY!
- If skin cracks → stop (overdone)
- If stem completely broke → see "Mistakes"

### Step 4: Secure (optional)

**If stem tries to straighten:**
- Tie with wire
- Or use support

**If stem holds itself:**
- Leave as is

### Step 5: Observation

**First 24 hours:**
- Branch may droop
- Leaves may slightly wilt
- Normal!

**Days 2-3:**
- Branch starts straightening
- Leaves recover

**Days 7-14:**
- "Knuckle" forms at break point (thickening)
- Stem 50-100% thicker
- Branch fully recovered

## What if Completely Broke?

**If skin tore or stem hanging:**

### Emergency Help

1. **Align parts:**
   - Connect broken parts as they were

2. **Secure with tape:**
   - Tightly wrap break point
   - Use garden tape or electrical tape

3. **Support:**
   - Place support so branch doesn't dangle

4. **Wait:**
   - 10-14 days for healing
   - Can remove tape after 7-10 days

**Result:**
80% of cases plant heals and continues growing!

## When to Use Supercropping?

### Goal 1: Height Control

**Situation:** Some branches taller than others

**Solution:**
Supercrop tallest branches → even canopy

**When:** Week 6-8 veg or week 1-2 flowering

---

### Goal 2: Stem Thickening

**Situation:** Want bigger yield

**Solution:**
Supercrop all main colas → thick stems → more transport → more buds

**When:** Week 5-7 veg

---

### Goal 3: "Saving" from Light

**Situation:** Tops too close to light, can't raise light

**Solution:**
Supercrop tops → bend away from light

**When:** Week 1-3 flowering (last resort!)

## Supercropping + Other Techniques

### Supercropping + LST

**Process:**
1. Week 3-6: LST (bending without breaking)
2. Week 7-8: Supercrop thickest branches
3. Result: Super-thick stems + even canopy

### Supercropping + SCROG

**Process:**
1. Weeks 4-7: Weaving through screen
2. Week 7 or week 1 flowering: Supercrop tall branches
3. Result: Perfectly even canopy

### Supercropping + Topping

**Process:**
1. Week 3-4: Topping → 2-4 colas
2. Week 6-7: Supercrop these colas
3. Result: Multiple thick colas

## Supercropping Mistakes

### ❌ Supercropping Woody Stems

**Problem:** Stem hard as wood (late flowering)
**Result:** Won't bend, will break completely

### ❌ Supercropping Thin Branches

**Problem:** Branch &lt;0.2 inch (5 mm) diameter
**Result:** Will fall off completely

### ❌ Supercropping at Top

**Problem:** Bent right under top (2 inches / 5 cm)
**Result:** Top may fall off or wilt

### ❌ Too Fast

**Problem:** Bent sharply without softening
**Result:** Skin tore

### ❌ Multiple HST at Once

**Problem:** Supercrop + topping + defoliation same day
**Result:** Plant in shock

## Recovery After Supercropping

### Days 1-3: Stress

**What happens:**
- Branch drooped
- Leaves wilted

**What to do:**
✅ Don't touch plant
✅ Maintain conditions (72-79°F / 22-26°C, 50-60% RH)
✅ Normal watering

### Days 4-7: Recovery

**What happens:**
- Branch starts straightening
- Leaves recovering
- Thickening forming at break point

**What to do:**
✅ Continue normal care

### Days 7-14: Strengthening

**What happens:**
- Thickening clearly visible
- Branch stronger than before
- Growth restored

**Result:**
Stem at break point 1.5-2x thicker!

## Supercropping for Different Situations

### Indica

**Specifics:**
- Thick stems → perfect for supercrop
- Compact → supercrop for height control not needed

**Use:**
For stem thickening on week 6-7 veg

### Sativa

**Specifics:**
- Thin stems → more careful
- Tall → supercrop for height control critical!

**Use:**
Week 1-2 flowering for stretch control

## Growie's Advice

Supercropping is technique for brave! First time scary (you hear crunch and think "that's it, killed plant"), but in 3 days you see branch recovered and understand plant power. Start with one side branch (not main cola!) on week 6-7 veg. Squeeze stem 10-20 seconds, then slowly bend until crunch. If accidentally break completely — don't panic, wrap with tape and in 80% cases it will heal! In Growie, photograph break point every 3 days — you'll see how thickening forms, it's impressive! And remember: supercropping is stress, don't do together with other HST, give 10-14 days between techniques!
