# Plant Training Techniques: Complete Overview

![Training Overview](/images/guides/training-overview.jpg)

Plant training is managing growth to increase yield. Proper training can double or triple your buds! Let's cover all methods from simple to advanced.

## Why Train Plants?

### Problem Without Training

**Natural growth:**
- 1 main cola (top)
- Lower branches in shade → small buds
- Uneven light distribution
- 50-70% of yield potential

### With Training

- Multiple equal colas
- All buds receive light
- Even canopy
- 100-200% yield

## Two Types of Training

### LST (Low Stress Training)

**What:** Bending and tying branches without damage

**Pros:**
✅ Safe (plant not damaged)
✅ Fast recovery (1-2 days)
✅ Works for autos
✅ Can do anytime

**Cons:**
❌ Requires constant work (tying)
❌ Slower than HST

**Examples:**
- LST (bending branches)
- SCROG (screen)
- SOG (many small plants)

---

### HST (High Stress Training)

**What:** Damaging plant (cutting, breaking) to change growth

**Pros:**
✅ Fast results
✅ Long-term effect
✅ Powerful structure changes

**Cons:**
❌ Plant stress (7-14 days recovery)
❌ Infection/mold risk
❌ NOT for autos!
❌ Veg stage only

**Examples:**
- Topping (cutting top)
- FIM (partial cut)
- Supercropping (stem break)
- Defoliation (removing leaves)

## All Techniques Comparison

| Technique | Type | Difficulty | Yield | Autos | Best For |
|-----------|------|------------|-------|-------|----------|
| **LST** | LST | Easy | +30-50% | ✅ Yes | Beginners, autos |
| **SCROG** | LST | Medium | +50-100% | ⚠️ Careful | Small spaces |
| **SOG** | LST | Easy | +100-150% | ✅ Yes | Fast harvest |
| **Topping** | HST | Easy | +40-60% | ❌ No | Height control |
| **FIM** | HST | Medium | +50-70% | ❌ No | Multiple colas |
| **Supercropping** | HST | Hard | +30-50% | ❌ No | Late veg |
| **Defoliation** | HST | Medium | +20-40% | ⚠️ Light | Flowering, circulation |

## Step-by-Step Technique Selection

### Step 1: Photo or Auto?

**Auto:**
→ Only LST, SCROG (light), SOG
→ Avoid HST!

**Photo:**
→ Any techniques

### Step 2: How many plants?

**1-2 plants:**
→ LST, SCROG, Topping + LST

**3-5 plants:**
→ LST, Topping, Defoliation

**Many (9-16+):**
→ SOG (minimal or no training)

### Step 3: How long veg?

**Short veg (3-4 weeks):**
→ LST, SOG

**Medium veg (5-6 weeks):**
→ LST + Topping, SCROG

**Long veg (7-8+ weeks):**
→ SCROG, Topping + FIM, Supercropping

### Step 4: Height limitation?

**Yes (low tent):**
→ SCROG, SOG, Topping

**No:**
→ LST, Topping + LST

## Techniques for Beginners

### First Grow

**Recommendation:** Basic LST

**Why:**
- Safe
- Simple
- See results immediately
- Learn to understand plant

### Second Grow

**Recommendation:** LST + Topping (if photo)

**Why:**
- Already understand plant
- Topping gives more yield
- Not too complex

### Third Grow and Beyond

**Recommendation:** SCROG or combinations

**Why:**
- Maximize yield
- Understand all processes

## Combining Techniques

### LST + Topping (Popular Combo)

**Process:**
1. Week 3: Topping
2. Week 4-8: LST all branches
3. Result: 8-12 equal colas

**Yield:** +80-120%

---

### SCROG + Defoliation

**Process:**
1. Week 4-6: Screen setup, LST
2. Flowering week 1: Defoliate lower leaves
3. Flowering week 3: Repeat defoliation
4. Result: Maximum circulation + light

**Yield:** +100-150%

---

### Topping + FIM + Supercropping

**Process (advanced):**
1. Week 3: Topping
2. Week 5: FIM on side branches
3. Week 7-8: Supercrop tallest
4. Result: 16-24 colas

**Yield:** +150-200%

## Training Schedule (Example)

### Photo 8 Weeks Veg

| Week | Technique | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 1-2 | — | Growth without training |
| 3 | Topping | Cut top → 2 colas |
| 4 | LST | Bend and tie both branches |
| 5 | FIM | FIM on 4 tops → 8-12 colas |
| 6 | LST | Continue tying |
| 7 | Supercropping | Bend tallest branches |
| 8 | Defoliation | Remove lower leaves |
| 9+ | Flowering | Switch to 12/12 |

---

### Auto (Full Cycle)

| Week | Technique | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 1-2 | — | Growth without training |
| 3 | LST | Start bending main cola |
| 4-6 | LST | Tie all branches |
| 7+ | — | Only watering, no stress |

## Training Mistakes

### ❌ HST on Autos

**Problem:** Autos don't have time to recover
**Result:** Yield decrease 30-50%

### ❌ Training During Flowering

**Problem:** Plant spends energy on recovery, not buds
**Result:** Small buds, stress

### ❌ Too Aggressive Training

**Problem:** Topping + FIM + Supercrop in 1 week
**Result:** Plant in shock, may die

### ❌ No Recovery Between HST

**Problem:** HST every week without break
**Result:** Plant constantly stressed, doesn't grow

## Training Tips

✅ **Start with LST** — safely learn

✅ **HST only during veg** — minimum 2 weeks before switch to 12/12

✅ **7-10 days recovery** after each HST

✅ **No more than 1 HST at once** — don't combine Topping + FIM same day

✅ **Autos = LST only** (or very light defoliation)

✅ **Sterile tools** for HST (alcohol on scissors)

✅ **Maintain conditions** after HST (temperature, humidity) for fast recovery

## Growie's Advice

Don't be afraid to train! Plants are very resilient and forgive mistakes during veg. Start with simple LST in first grow — just bend main cola and tie. In second grow try Topping — it gives +50% yield and you'll understand the principle. By third grow try SCROG — you'll see maximum potential! In Growie, log every training: what you did, when, how plant reacted — after 2-3 cycles you'll become training master! And remember: better undertrain than overtrain — excessive stress kills yield.
