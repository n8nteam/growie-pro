# Optimal Climate: Temperature, Humidity, VPD

![Climate Control](/images/guides/climate.jpg)

Climate is one of the key factors for a successful grow. Understanding the relationship between temperature, humidity, and VPD will help you grow healthy and productive plants.

## What is VPD?

**VPD (Vapor Pressure Deficit)** measures the difference between the moisture in the air and how much moisture the air can hold. It tells you how aggressively the air "wants" to pull moisture from your plants.

- **Low VPD** (< 0.4 kPa): air is too humid, poor transpiration → mold risk
- **Optimal VPD** (0.8-1.2 kPa): active transpiration and nutrient uptake
- **High VPD** (> 1.6 kPa): air is too dry, plant stress → stomata close

## Optimal Parameters by Stage

### Seedling Stage
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Temperature | 73-77°F (23-25°C) |
| Humidity | 65-70% |
| VPD | 0.4-0.8 kPa |
| Light | 18h / 6h |

### Vegetative Stage
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Temperature | 72-82°F (22-28°C) |
| Humidity | 50-65% |
| VPD | 0.8-1.2 kPa |
| Light | 18-20h / 4-6h |

### Early Flowering
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Temperature | 68-79°F (20-26°C) |
| Humidity | 45-55% |
| VPD | 1.0-1.4 kPa |
| Light | 12h / 12h |

### Late Flowering
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Temperature | 64-75°F (18-24°C) |
| Humidity | 35-45% |
| VPD | 1.2-1.6 kPa |
| Light | 12h / 12h |

## Controlling Temperature

### Overheating (Too Hot)
1. Increase exhaust fan speed
2. Add intake fan
3. Use LED instead of HPS
4. Run lights at night (when it's cooler)
5. Use air conditioning

### Too Cold
1. Use an oil-filled heater
2. Reduce exhaust at night
3. Insulate the tent
4. Use a root zone heater

## Controlling Humidity

### Too Dry
- Humidifier
- Wet towel in the tent
- Reduce exhaust

### Too Humid
- Dehumidifier
- Increase exhaust
- Remove excess foliage (defoliation)

## Day/Night Temperature Differential

The gap between day and night temps matters:

- **Optimal**: 4-9°F (2-5°C) difference
- **Acceptable**: up to 18°F (10°C)
- **Dangerous**: more than 18°F (10°C) — plant stress

Too large a gap can cause:
- Condensation on leaves
- Mold risk (Botrytis)
- Slowed growth

## Monitoring with Growie

The Growie app lets you:
- Record climate parameters multiple times a day
- Automatically calculate VPD
- Get alerts when parameters deviate
- Analyze charts across an entire cycle
- Compare conditions between grows

Proper climate is 50% of success. Control it with Growie!
