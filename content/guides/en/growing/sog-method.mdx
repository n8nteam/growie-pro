# SOG (Sea of Green): Fast Harvest

![SOG Method](/images/guides/sog-method.jpg)

SOG (Sea of Green) is growing many small plants instead of few large. Short veg, fast harvest, high harvest frequency!

## What is SOG?

**SOG** is "sea of green" when entire tent filled with many small plants (9-16+), each with 1 main cola.

**Principle:**
Instead of training 1-2 plants for 8 weeks veg, you plant 12-16 plants and switch to flowering after 2-3 weeks. Each plant gives 1 big bud.

**Result:**
- Harvest every 8-10 weeks (vs 12-14)
- Yield same or more
- Electricity savings (shorter veg)

## SOG Pros and Cons

### Pros ✅

- **Fast turnover:** Harvest every 2-2.5 months
- **Simple training:** Minimal or none
- **Efficiency:** Short veg = less electricity
- **For autos:** Perfect match
- **Even canopy:** All plants same height

### Cons ❌

- **Many plants:** Legally risky (where there's limit)
- **More work:** Water/feed 12-16 plants
- **Need clones or fem seeds:** All plants must be identical
- **More pots:** Need space and materials

## SOG vs SCROG

| Parameter | SOG | SCROG |
|-----------|-----|-------|
| **Plants** | 9-16+ | 1-2 |
| **Veg** | 2-3 weeks | 6-8 weeks |
| **Full cycle** | 8-10 weeks | 12-14 weeks |
| **Training** | Minimal | Intensive |
| **Yield/plant** | Small | Large |
| **Total yield** | High | High |
| **Legality** | Risk (many plants) | Safe (1-2 plants) |
| **Difficulty** | Medium | High |

## When to Use SOG?

### Ideal for:

✅ **Commercial grows:** Fast turnover
✅ **Autos:** Short cycle anyway
✅ **Clones:** All identical = even canopy
✅ **Short indicas:** Compact plants
✅ **Perpetual harvest:** Constant cycle

### Not suitable for:

❌ **Where plant limits:** Risk violating limit
❌ **Sativas:** Too tall, stretch
❌ **Beginners with seeds:** Hard to get identical plants

## Optimal Planting Density

### 2.5×2.5 ft (80×80 cm) Tent

**9 plants:**
- Pots: 0.8-1 gal (3-4 L) each
- Spacing: 10-12 inches (25-30 cm) between
- Pattern: 3×3

**12 plants:**
- Pots: 0.5-0.8 gal (2-3 L) each
- Spacing: 8-10 inches (20-25 cm)
- Pattern: 3×4

### 3×3 ft (100×100 cm) Tent

**16 plants:**
- Pots: 0.8-1 gal (3-4 L)
- Spacing: 10 inches (25 cm)
- Pattern: 4×4

**20 plants:**
- Pots: 0.5-0.8 gal (2-3 L)
- Spacing: 8 inches (20 cm)
- Pattern: 4×5

### 4×4 ft (120×120 cm) Tent

**25 plants:**
- Pots: 0.8-1 gal (3-4 L)
- Spacing: 9.5 inches (24 cm)
- Pattern: 5×5

**Important:** Don't plant too dense! Need air circulation.

## SOG: Step-by-Step

### Stage 1: Preparation (week 0)

**Choose material:**

**Option 1: Clones (best!)**
- All plants identical
- Even canopy guaranteed
- Known genetics

**Option 2: Fem seeds**
- Same strain from same breeder
- Will be slight height difference
- Cheaper than clones

**Don't use:**
❌ Regular seeds (50% males)
❌ Different strains (different heights)

**Pots:**
- 0.5-1 gal (2-4 L) each
- Good drainage

### Stage 2: Seedlings (weeks 1-2)

**Goal:** Grow healthy seedlings

**Actions:**
- Normal care
- No training!
- Let plants strengthen to 6-8 inches (15-20 cm)

### Stage 3: Short Veg (week 3)

**Goal:** Minimal veg

**Photos:**
- 2-3 weeks veg
- Height: 8-12 inches (20-30 cm)
- Switch 12/12

**Autos:**
- No actions (will flower anyway)

**Training (optional):**
- Light LST main cola (if need height control)
- Or no training at all

### Stage 4: Flowering (weeks 4-12)

**Stretch (weeks 1-3):**
- Plants stretch 50-100%
- Watch they don't touch each other

**Late flowering (weeks 4-10):**
- Maintain conditions
- Water/feed (lots of work!)

**Important:**
- Watch humidity (<50% RH)
- Good circulation (mold risk with dense planting!)

### Stage 5: Harvest (week 10-12)

**Cut all plants:**
- Easy, since they're small
- Can cut whole plants

**Immediately plant new batch:**
- Perpetual harvest!

## Training for SOG

### Option 1: No Training (simplest)

**Process:**
- No training
- Plants grow naturally
- 1 main cola each

**Pros:**
- Simple
- Fast

**Cons:**
- Uneven canopy (different heights)

---

### Option 2: Lollipopping (recommended!)

**Process:**
1. Week 3 veg or week 1 flowering
2. Remove all lower branches (leave only top 3-4 tiers)
3. Result: Plant like "lollipop" — bare stem + fluffy top

**Pros:**
- Energy goes to main cola
- Better circulation
- Bigger buds

---

### Option 3: Light LST

**Process:**
- Week 2-3: Bend main cola
- Goal: Height control

**When to use:**
- Some plants taller than others
- Need to level canopy

## SOG for Autos

**Perfect combination!**

**Why:**
✅ Autos already short (8-10 weeks)
✅ Don't need training
✅ All start flowering together (if planted together)

**Process:**
1. Plant 12-16 autos together
2. No training (or light LST)
3. Week 8-10: Harvest
4. Immediately plant new batch

**Yield:**
- Every 10 weeks
- 5 harvests per year!

## Perpetual Harvest with SOG

**Idea:** Constant harvest flow

**How:**
1. Divide tent into 2-3 zones
2. Every 3-4 weeks plant new batch
3. Result: Harvest every month!

**Example:**
- Zone 1: Weeks 1-4 (veg)
- Zone 2: Weeks 5-8 (early flowering)
- Zone 3: Weeks 9-12 (late flowering + harvest)

**Difficulty:** Need different conditions (light, humidity)

## Growie's Advice

SOG is best technique for autos and fast turnover! If you can legally have 12-16 plants — try SOG. Plant 12 autos of same strain in 0.8 gal (3L) pots, arrange 3×4 in 2.5×2.5 ft (80×80 cm) tent, don't do any training (or light lollipopping). In 10 weeks you'll get same yield as 2-3 large plants, but spent less time and electricity! In Growie, keep diary for each plant — you'll see which grow faster and choose best phenotype. And remember: SOG = speed, not size!
