# SCROG (Screen of Green): Maximum from Minimum

![SCROG Method](/images/guides/scrog-method.jpg)

SCROG (Screen of Green) is using horizontal screen above plants to create perfectly even canopy. Maximum yield from minimum number of plants. Ideal for small spaces!

## What is SCROG?

**SCROG** is horizontal net above plants, through which you direct branches to create even canopy.

**Principle:**
Screen forces all branches to grow horizontally. When branch tries growing up, you bend it under screen and direct to free cell. Result — all tops at same height.

**Result:**
- 1-2 plants fill entire tent
- All buds receive maximum light
- Yield +50-150%

## When to Use SCROG?

### Ideal for:

✅ **1-2 plants:** Will fill entire tent
✅ **Small spaces:** 2×2 ft to 4×4 ft (60×60 cm to 120×120 cm)
✅ **Low tents:** &lt;5 ft (150 cm) height
✅ **Photos:** Need long veg
✅ **Sativas:** Control stretching

### Not suitable for:

❌ **Autos:** (but possible, see below)
❌ **Many plants:** (>4gt;4) — better SOG
❌ **Unstable genetics:** Need predictable plants

## What You Need for SCROG?

### Screen

**Options:**

1. **Ready SCROG net:**
   - $15-30
   - Plastic/nylon
   - Cell size: 2×2 inches (5×5 cm)

2. **Plastic mesh/netting:**
   - $10-15 per meter
   - Hardware store
   - Cell size: 2-3 inches (5-7 cm)

3. **DIY from rope:**
   - $5-10
   - Stretch ropes crisscross
   - Cell: 2-3 inches (5-7 cm)

**Important:** Cell NOT smaller than 2 inches (5 cm) (hard to work), NOT larger than 4 inches (10 cm) (branches slip through).

## SCROG: Step-by-Step

### Stage 1: Preparation (weeks 1-3)

**Goal:** Grow healthy plant

1. **Plant 1-2 plants:**
   - 2.5×2.5 ft (80×80 cm) tent: 1 plant
   - 4×4 ft (120×120 cm) tent: 2 plants

2. **Normal growth:**
   - No training
   - Let plant strengthen

3. **Optional:**
   - Week 3: Topping → 2 colas
   - Speeds up screen filling

### Stage 2: Screen Setup (week 3-4)

**When:** Plant 10-12 inches (25-30 cm) tall

**Screen height:**
- **Above pot:** 8-12 inches (20-30 cm)
- **Leave space:** For work under screen

**How to install:**
1. Assemble frame or attach screen to walls
2. Stretch screen horizontally
3. Check screen strong (will hold bud weight!)

### Stage 3: Weaving (weeks 4-7)

**Goal:** Fill entire screen

**Every 2-3 days:**
1. **Find branches above screen:**
   - They try growing up

2. **Bend under screen:**
   - Gently bend branch
   - Direct to free cell nearby

3. **Secure (optional):**
   - Wire or clip
   - After week untie (branch fixed)

**Formation:**
- From center to edges (spiral)
- Or from one edge to other
- Fill all cells evenly

**When to stop:**
- Screen filled 70-80%
- Leave 20-30% for stretch during flowering!

### Stage 4: Switching to Flowering (week 7-8)

**When to switch 12/12:**
- Screen filled 70-80%
- Don't wait 100%! Plant will stretch during flowering

**First day of 12/12:**
1. **Defoliation:**
   - Remove all leaves under screen
   - Leave only what's above screen

2. **Last ties:**
   - Level canopy

### Stage 5: Stretch (flowering weeks 1-3)

**What happens:**
- Plant stretches 50-100%
- Branches grow above screen

**What to do:**
- **Weeks 1-2:** Continue bending under screen
- **Week 3:** Stop (plant stops stretching)
- **Branches above screen:** These are your future buds!

**Result:**
- Screen filled 100%
- All tops even (±2-4 inches / 5-10 cm)

### Stage 6: Flowering (weeks 4-10)

**What to do:**
- Maintain conditions
- Water (difficult, but carefully)
- Watch buds

**Don't touch:**
- Don't move branches
- Don't relocate tent
- Plants "woven"!

### Stage 7: Harvest

**Problem:** Hard to cut (branches in screen)

**Solution:**
1. Cut main stems at base
2. Pull branches out of screen one by one
3. Or cut screen (if cheap)

## SCROG for Autos

**Problem:** Autos don't wait, start flowering week 3-4

**Can you SCROG?**
⚠️ Yes, but difficult!

**How:**
1. **Install screen early:** Week 2 (8 inches / 20 cm above pot)
2. **Be fast:** Fill screen weeks 2-4
3. **Gentler:** Less aggression, more LST
4. **Result:** +20-40% (less than photos)

**Verdict:** Better use LST for autos.

## Growie's Advice

SCROG is technique for patient! Need 6-8 weeks veg, but result worth it — yield like 4-6 plants! Start with 1 plant in 2.5×2.5 ft (80×80 cm) tent, do topping on week 3, install screen on week 4 at 10-12 inches (25-30 cm) height. Every 2-3 days bend branches under screen, fill from center to edges. Switch 12/12 when screen 70-80% filled — plant will stretch and fill rest! In Growie, photograph screen every 3 days — you'll see how fast it fills. And remember: SCROG is marathon, not sprint, don't rush to switch flowering!
