# Curing: Improving Taste and Effect

![Curing in jars](/images/guides/curing-jars.jpg)

Curing is the final stage after drying that transforms good buds into excellent ones. Proper curing improves taste, aroma, effect, and makes smoke maximally smooth. It's patience that pays off.

## What Is Curing and Why It's Needed

### What Happens During Curing

**Biochemical processes:**

1. **Breakdown of remaining chlorophyll**
   - Chlorophyll continues breaking down
   - Green "grassy" taste disappears
   - Process takes 2-8 weeks

2. **Terpene transformation**
   - Terpenes stabilize
   - Aroma becomes more complex and rich
   - Smell "bouquet" opens up

3. **Micro-decarboxylation**
   - THCA partially converts to THC (naturally)
   - Effect becomes smoother and more balanced

4. **Even moisture distribution**
   - Moisture from bud centers moves to surface
   - Buds become uniform

### Comparison: With vs Without Curing

| Parameter | Without Curing (right after drying) | With Curing (4-8 weeks) |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Taste** | Grassy, harsh, green | Sweet, complex, smooth |
| **Aroma** | Weak or one-dimensional | Rich, multi-layered |
| **Smoke** | Harsh, throat irritation | Smooth, pleasant |
| **Effect** | Sharp, uneven | Balanced, smooth |
| **Ash** | Gray/black | White |
| **Storage** | Poor storage (mold/overdrying) | Stable for months |

### Minimum vs Optimal Duration

**Minimum:** 2 weeks
- Chlorophyll partially broken down
- Taste improved
- Can smoke already

**Optimal:** 4-8 weeks
- Chlorophyll completely broken down
- Peak taste and aroma
- Perfect smoking

**Maximum:** 6-12 months
- For connoisseurs
- Terpenes continue transforming
- After 12 months — slow degradation

## Preparing for Curing

### Checking Bud Readiness After Drying

**Tests:**

1. **Stem snap test:**
   - Small stems snap when bent

2. **Appearance:**
   - Dry to touch outside
   - Spring back when squeezed (not soft, don't crumble)

3. **Jar test (24 hours):**
   - Put in jar, close
   - After 24 hours buds NOT wet outside
   - If became wet → dry another 1-2 days

**Important:** Don't start curing if buds too wet → mold!

### Choosing Containers

#### Glass Jars (Best Option for &lt;12 months)

**Types:**
- **Mason jars** (Ball, Kerr) — classic
- Jars with rubber seal (more airtight)
- Regular glass jars with screw lid

**Size:**
- 16-32 oz (500-1000 ml) — optimal for 1-2 oz (30-60g)
- Don't fill more than 75-80% (need air)

**Pros:**
✅ Airtight
✅ Don't absorb smells
✅ Can see contents
✅ Easy to clean
✅ Reusable

**Cons:**
❌ Glass fragile
❌ Lets light through (store in darkness!)

#### CVault / Metal Containers

**What it is:**
Opaque metal containers with airtight lid.

**Price:** $20-40

**Pros:**
✅ Don't let light through
✅ Airtight
✅ Design for Boveda pack
✅ Durable

**Cons:**
❌ Expensive
❌ Can't see contents without opening

#### Infinity Jars (Purple Glass)

**What it is:**
Purple glass jars (Miron glass) — block all light except violet and infrared.

**Price:** $20-50

**Pros:**
✅ Light protection (best)
✅ Glass (don't absorb smells)
✅ Look beautiful

**Cons:**
❌ Expensive
❌ Fragile

**Worth it:**
If storing long (>1gt;12 months) and budget allows — yes.

### Boveda Packs (Optional but Recommended)

**What it is:**
Two-way humidity regulators — automatically maintain set humidity (62% or 58%).

**How it works:**
- If humidity &lt;62% → pack humidifies
- If humidity &gt;62% → pack absorbs moisture

**Sizes:**
- 4 g — for jars up to 16 oz (500 ml)
- 8 g — for jars 16-32 oz (500-1000 ml)
- 67 g — for large containers (>1gt;1 L)

**Price:**
$5-8 per pack, works 2-6 months.

**Humidity:**
- **62% RH** — for curing and storage (universal)
- **58% RH** — for long storage (>6gt;6 months)

**Pros:**
✅ No burping needed after first 2 weeks
✅ Automatic humidity control
✅ Protection from overdrying/overwetting

**Cons:**
❌ Additional cost
❌ Takes space in jar
❌ Some claim Boveda "kills" terpenes (debatable)

## Curing Process: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Filling Jars

1. **Prepare glass jars:**
   - Wash and dry
   - Clean, no smells

2. **Fill jars with buds:**
   - Fill to 75-80% volume
   - Don't pack tight (need air circulation)
   - Leave 20-25% empty space

3. **Optional: add Boveda 62%:**
   - One pack per 16-32 oz (500-1000 ml) jar

4. **Close jars tight**

5. **Label jars:**
   - Curing start date
   - Strain

### Step 2: First Week (Burp Daily)

**Burping** — opening jars to release moisture and refresh air.

**Frequency:** 2-3 times per day

**How to burp:**

1. **Open jar**
2. **Check buds:**
   - Smell: should be pleasant (not musty, not ammonia)
   - Touch: not sticking, not wet outside
   - Look: no mold
3. **Leave open 5-15 minutes:**
   - If buds wet outside → 15-30 minutes
   - If dry → 5-10 minutes
4. **Close jar back**

**Signs everything going right:**
✅ Smell pleasant, getting stronger each day
✅ Buds dry outside, spring back when squeezed
✅ No mold

**Problem signs:**
❌ **Ammonia/musty smell** — too wet! Burp longer (1-2 hours) or take buds out to re-dry
❌ **Buds sticking** — too wet, burp more often (4-5 times/day)
❌ **Mold** — throw away these buds, check other jars

### Step 3: Second Week (Burp Less Often)

**Frequency:** Once per day

**Process:** Same, but can keep open 5-10 minutes.

**What's happening:**
- Moisture inside buds continues coming out (slower)
- Chlorophyll breaking down
- Terpenes stabilizing

### Step 4: Third-Fourth Week (Burp Rarely)

**Frequency:** Once every 2-3 days

**Process:** Open, check smell and condition, leave open 5-10 minutes, close.

### Step 5: After 4 Weeks (Burping Optional)

**If using Boveda:**
- Burping not needed at all
- Boveda automatically controls humidity
- Just store jars in dark cool place

**If NOT using Boveda:**
- Burping once a week (5 minutes)
- Check condition

### Burping Frequency Table

| Week | Burping Frequency | Opening Duration |
|------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1 | 2-3 times per day | 5-15 minutes |
| 2 | Once per day | 5-10 minutes |
| 3-4 | Once every 2-3 days | 5 minutes |
| 5+ | Once per week (or not needed with Boveda) | 5 minutes |

## Growie's Tip

Don't save $10-15 on Boveda packs — it's the best investment in harvest quality! With them curing becomes "set and forget" after first 2 weeks. Minimum 4 weeks curing is standard, but if you can wait 6-8 weeks, your buds will be like from premium dispensaries. Keep curing diary in Growie: record when started, how often burped, when taste became perfect — helps with future cycles. First week burp every day 2-3 times — it's CRITICAL for preventing mold! And remember: patience pays off, don't rush to smoke right after drying — quality difference is huge!
