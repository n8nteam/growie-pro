# When to Harvest: Determining Readiness

![Trichomes under microscope](/images/guides/trichomes-harvest.jpg)

Determining the right harvest moment is one of the most important grower skills. A difference of 3-7 days can dramatically change the effect and quality of your harvest. Let's break down all the methods for determining readiness.

## Why Precise Harvest Timing Matters

### Harvesting Too Early

**Consequences:**
- Low cannabinoid concentration (-30-50% of potential)
- Green "grassy" taste
- Weak effect
- Lower weight (buds didn't reach full size)

### Harvesting Too Late

**Consequences:**
- THC degradation into CBN (sedative effect, sleepiness)
- Terpene loss (aroma weakens)
- Amber trichomes = "couch-lock" effect
- Yield loss (trichomes fall off)

### The Perfect Window

**Peak maturity:**
- Maximum THC concentration
- Full terpene profile
- Optimal bud weight
- Desired effect (energetic → sedative)

**Window duration:** 3-7 days (depends on strain)

## Method 1: Checking Trichomes (Most Accurate)

### What Are Trichomes

**Trichomes** — glandular hairs on buds, leaves, and stems. They contain cannabinoids (THC, CBD, CBN) and terpenes.

**Types of trichomes:**
1. **Bulbous** — small, 10-15 microns
2. **Capitate sessile** — 20-30 microns
3. **Capitate-stalked** — 50-100 microns
   - **These are the main ones!** Check these.

### Trichome Colors and Their Meaning

#### Clear (transparent)

**Appearance:**
- Glass-clear
- Shiny
- Like water droplets

**Status:**
- Plant not ready yet
- THC still forming
- Cannabinoids haven't peaked

**Effect:** Weak or absent

**Action:** Wait another 1-2 weeks

#### Cloudy/Milky

**Appearance:**
- White, opaque
- Milky color
- Like plastic

**Status:**
- **Peak THC concentration!**
- Maximum cannabinoids
- Full terpene profile

**Effect:**
- Energetic, cerebral (if 100% cloudy)
- Clean, without sleepiness

**Action:**
- If you want uplifting effect → harvest at 70-90% cloudy
- If balanced → wait for 10-20% amber

#### Amber

**Appearance:**
- Yellow-brown
- Golden
- Darkened

**Status:**
- THC degrading into CBN (cannabinol)
- Terpenes starting to evaporate
- Plant overmaturing

**Effect:**
- Sedative, relaxing
- Couch-lock
- Sleepiness

**Action:**
- If you want sedative effect → wait for 30-50% amber
- More than 50% amber = overripe

### Readiness Table

| Trichomes | Effect | When to Harvest |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| 100% clear | None | Too early, wait |
| 70-90% clear, 10-30% cloudy | Weak | Still early (1 week) |
| 100% cloudy, 0% amber | Energetic, clean | Sativa effect |
| 70-80% cloudy, 20-30% amber | Balanced | **Perfect for most** |
| 50% cloudy, 50% amber | Relaxing | Sedative |
| >70% amber | Very sedative | Overripe, too late |

### Where to Check Trichomes

**Correct places:**
- Top of buds (calyxes)
- Middle of plant
- Upper colas

**Wrong places:**
❌ Large fan leaves (mature earlier)
❌ Sugar leaves inside buds (lag behind calyxes)
❌ Bottom buds (may be immature)

**Rule:** Check calyxes (the buds where pistils grow from), not leaves!

### Tools for Checking

#### 1. Jeweler's Loupe (60x-100x)

**Pros:**
- Cheap ($3-10)
- Compact
- LED light

**Cons:**
- Need to get close
- Hard to hold steady
- Not all models are clear

**Recommendations:**
- Loupe with LED 60x-100x magnification
- Examples: Carson MicroBrite, Jarlink 60x-100x

#### 2. USB Microscope

**Pros:**
- Photos and video
- Large screen (computer/smartphone)
- Easy to focus
- Can compare day-to-day changes

**Cons:**
- More expensive ($15-40)
- Need computer/phone
- Not always convenient in tent

**Recommendations:**

- Celestron Handheld ($35-40)

#### 3. Pocket Microscope (60x-120x)

**Pros:**
- Portable
- Standalone (batteries)
- Clear picture

**Cons:**
- More expensive than loupe ($20-30)
- Requires focusing

#### What to Choose?

| Budget | Tool | Use Case |

| <$10 | Jeweler's loupe 60x | Beginners, quick check |
| $15-25 | USB microscope | Accurate diagnosis, photos |
| $20-30 | Pocket microscope | Experienced, portability |

## Method 2: Checking Pistils

### What Are Pistils

**Pistils** — hairs sticking out of calyxes (female reproductive organs).

**Color:**
- White → orange/brown → curled/dried

### Pistil Maturity Stages

#### White Pistils (early flowering)

**Signs:**
- 70-90% pistils white
- Sticking out
- Straight

**Readiness:** Not ready, minimum 2-4 weeks until harvest

#### Orange Pistils (mid stage)

**Signs:**
- 50-70% pistils darkened
- Some still white

**Readiness:** Approaching, 1-2 weeks until harvest

#### Dark Curled Pistils (maturity)

**Signs:**
- 70-90% pistils orange/brown
- Curled, pressed to buds
- No new white ones appearing

**Readiness:** Ready to harvest!

### Readiness Table by Pistils

| Pistils | Readiness | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| >70% white | Not ready | Wait 3-4 weeks |
| 50-70% white | Approaching | Start checking trichomes |
| 70-90% dark | Ready | Check trichomes, harvest |
| 100% dark | Possibly overripe | Urgently check trichomes |

### Method Limitations

❌ **Not accurate!** Pistils change color not only from maturity:
- Low humidity → pistils darken early
- Physical damage → pistils darken locally
- Genetics → some strains always have white pistils or vice versa

✅ **Use as supplement** to trichome checking, not as main method!

## Method 3: Flowering Calendar (Approximate)

### Timing by Plant Type

#### Autoflowers

**Total cycle:** 8-12 weeks from seed to harvest

**Flowering:** 6-8 weeks

**When to check:**
- Start checking trichomes at week 6 of flowering
- Usually ready at week 7-8

#### Photoperiod Sativas

**Flowering:** 10-14 weeks (after switching to 12/12)

**When to check:**
- From week 10 of flowering
- Usually ready at week 11-13

#### Photoperiod Indicas

**Flowering:** 7-9 weeks (after 12/12)

**When to check:**
- From week 7 of flowering
- Usually ready at week 8-9

#### Hybrids

**Flowering:** 8-10 weeks

**When to check:**
- From week 8

### Calendar Method Limitations

❌ Breeder timelines are approximate
❌ Conditions affect speed (light, temperature, stress)
❌ Phenotypes of the same strain can differ by 1-2 weeks

✅ Use calendar as **guideline**, trichomes as truth!

## Method 4: External Signs

### Readiness Signs

#### 1. Growth Stops

**What you see:**
- Buds stopped growing
- No new calyxes appearing
- Plant growth stopped

#### 2. Leaf Color Change

**What you see:**
- Fan leaves yellowing (normal!)
- Plant "fading" — giving nutrients to buds
- Sugar leaves inside buds still green

**Important:** Yellowing at end of flower is good! Sign of maturity.

#### 3. Calyx Swelling

**What you see:**
- Calyxes (buds) swollen
- Dense, heavy
- Covered in trichomes

#### 4. Stronger Smell

**What you see (or rather, smell):**
- Smell became more intense
- More complex aroma (not just green)

### Comprehensive Assessment

✅ If **all signs** match → check trichomes carefully, likely ready!

## Mistakes in Determining Readiness

### Mistake 1: Only Looking at Pistils

**Why wrong:**
Pistils change color from many factors (humidity, touching, genetics), not just maturity.

**Solution:**
Always check trichomes!

### Mistake 2: Checking Trichomes on Leaves

**Why wrong:**
Trichomes on leaves mature earlier or later than on calyxes.

**Solution:**
Only look at calyxes (flower buds).

### Mistake 3: Rushing

**Why wrong:**
"One more week" often turns into +20-30% yield and significantly better quality.

**Solution:**
Patience! If in doubt — wait another 3-5 days and check again.

### Mistake 4: Relying Only on Calendar

**Why wrong:**
Breeder timelines are averaged. Your conditions may speed up or slow down maturation.

**Solution:**
Calendar as guideline, trichomes as truth!

### Mistake 5: Harvesting Whole Plant at Once

**Why wrong:**
Top buds mature 3-7 days earlier than bottom ones (more light).

**Solution:**
Harvest in stages: tops first, bottoms 5-7 days later.

## Readiness Determination Strategy

### Step-by-Step Checklist

**2 weeks before expected harvest:**

1. Buy 60x+ loupe or USB microscope
2. Start checking trichomes **every 2-3 days**
3. Photo results (USB microscope) — track dynamics

**When you see first cloudy trichomes:**

4. Check **every day**
5. Record percentage cloudy/amber
6. Assess pistils (70-90% dark?)
7. Assess external signs

**When 70-80% trichomes cloudy:**

8. Decide what effect you want:
   - Energetic → harvest at 80-90% cloudy
   - Balanced → wait for 20-30% amber
   - Sedative → wait for 40-50% amber
9. Stop feeding (flush) 7-10 days before harvest
10. Harvest!

## Growie's Tip

The best investment for accurate harvest timing is a $20-25 USB microscope! You'll see trichomes in detail, can take photos, compare changes and precisely determine the moment. Check trichomes daily when you see first cloudy ones — it becomes an exciting game! In Growie you can keep a check diary: record daily percentage of cloudy/amber trichomes, attach photos. After a couple cycles you'll learn to determine harvest time perfectly. And remember: better to harvest 3 days late than 3 days early!
