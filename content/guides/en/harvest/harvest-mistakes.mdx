# Common Harvest Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

![Harvest mistakes](/images/guides/harvest-mistakes.jpg)

Harvest, drying, and curing are final stages where you can ruin months of work. Let's break down all critical mistakes and how to avoid them.

## Mistakes in Determining Readiness

### Mistake 1: Harvested Too Early

**Signs you harvested early:**
- Trichomes still clear (not cloudy)
- Pistils white (>5gt;50%)
- Buds airy, not dense

**Consequences:**
- Weak effect (THC didn't peak)
- Low weight (-30-50% of potential)
- Green "grassy" taste
- Buds didn't reach full size

**Why it happens:**
- Impatience ("8 weeks already, time!")
- Didn't check trichomes (relied only on pistils/calendar)
- Panic due to problems (deficiencies, mold)

**How to avoid:**
✅ Always check trichomes! (60x+ loupe or USB microscope)
✅ Wait until 70-80% trichomes cloudy
✅ If in doubt — wait another 3-5 days
✅ Better 3 days late than 3 days early

**Rule:** If not sure it's ready — it's not ready!

### Mistake 2: Harvested Too Late

**Signs you harvested late:**
- Trichomes amber (>5gt;50-70%)
- Pistils all brown, dried
- Leaves almost all yellow/fallen

**Consequences:**
- Sedative "couch-lock" effect (THC → CBN)
- Terpene loss (weak aroma)
- Trichomes falling off (weight loss)

**Why it happens:**
- "One more week will give more yield" (false after peak!)
- Forgot to check
- Didn't have time

**How to avoid:**
✅ Check trichomes daily when you see first cloudy ones
✅ Don't wait for &gt;30% amber (unless want sedative effect)
✅ Plan harvest time in advance

### Mistake 3: Relied Only on Calendar

**Problem:**
"Breeder said 8 weeks flowering, so I'm cutting at week 8."

**Why wrong:**
- Breeder timelines are approximate
- Conditions (light, temperature, nutrition) affect speed
- Phenotypes of same strain differ by 1-2 weeks

**Consequences:**
Early or late harvest.

**How to avoid:**
✅ Calendar — guideline, trichomes — truth!
✅ Start checking trichomes 1 week before breeder estimate

### Mistake 4: Relied Only on Pistils

**Problem:**
"70% pistils brown, so it's ready" (not always!).

**Why wrong:**
Pistils darken not only from maturity:
- Low humidity → pistils darken early
- Physical damage (touching, water spray)
- Some strains always have white pistils

**Consequences:**
Early or late harvest (pistils unreliable).

**How to avoid:**
✅ Pistils — additional sign, not main one
✅ Check trichomes!

## Mistakes in Preparing for Harvest

### Mistake 5: Didn't Flush

**What it is:**
Stopping nutrient feeding 7-14 days before harvest, watering with clean water.

**Consequences if didn't flush:**
- Chemical aftertaste (mineral salts in plant)
- Harsh smoke (throat irritation)
- Black ash (instead of white)
- Crackles when smoking

**Why it happens:**
- Didn't know about flushing
- "Feared" plant would die without nutrients

**How to avoid:**
✅ Flush minimum 7-10 days (soil/coco)
✅ Flush minimum 3-5 days (hydro)
✅ Leaf yellowing during flush — normal!

### Mistake 6: Watered Before Harvest

**Problem:**
Watered few hours before cutting.

**Consequences:**
- Plant heavy, hard to hang
- Long drying (14-21 days instead of 7-14)
- Mold risk (excess moisture)

**How to avoid:**
✅ Last watering 24-48 hours before harvest
✅ Let soil dry (but not completely!)

### Mistake 7: Cut Midday (Lights On)

**Problem:**
Cut during day when lights on, hot.

**Consequences:**
- Terpenes partially evaporated (light + heat)
- Weaker aroma

**Why it happens:**
- Didn't know time of day matters
- Didn't have time morning/evening

**How to avoid:**
✅ Cut in morning before lights on
✅ Or evening after lights off
✅ Terpene concentration highest in darkness

## Mistakes During Cutting and Trimming

### Mistake 8: Didn't Wear Gloves

**Consequences:**
- Hands in resin (very hard to wash!)
- Trichomes stay on hands (cannabinoid loss)
- Scissors stick every 5 minutes

**How to avoid:**
✅ Always use nitrile/latex gloves
✅ Change gloves every 30-60 minutes

### Mistake 9: Too Tight Trim

**Problem:**
Trimmed all leaves to "bald" state, touched calyxes.

**Consequences:**
- Trichome damage
- Weight loss (cut part of buds)
- Buds look "bald"

**How to avoid:**
✅ Trim only sticking sugar leaves
✅ Don't touch calyxes (buds themselves)
✅ Leave some leaves for trichome protection

### Mistake 10: Threw Away Trim

**Problem:**
Threw away sugar leaves with trichomes.

**Consequences:**
- Lost 10-30% cannabinoids
- Could have made extracts, hash, oil

**How to avoid:**
✅ Always collect sugar leaves (with trichomes)
✅ Freeze for extracts or dry for dry sift
✅ Only throw away large fan leaves (no trichomes)

### Mistake 11: Wet Trim in Dry Climate

**Problem:**
Did wet trim (trimmed leaves immediately) in dry climate (<5lt;50% RH).

**Consequences:**
- Very fast drying (3-5 days)
- Grassy taste
- Terpenes evaporated
- Chlorophyll not broken down

**How to avoid:**
✅ **Dry trim** in dry climate (<5lt;55% RH)
✅ **Wet trim** only in humid climate (>6gt;60% RH)

## Mistakes During Drying

### Mistake 12: Too Fast Drying (<5lt;5 days)

**Causes:**
- Low humidity (<4lt;45% RH)
- High temperature (>7gt;75°F / 24°C)
- Fan blowing directly on buds
- Wet trim in dry climate

**Consequences:**
- Grassy "hay" smell
- Harsh smoke
- Terpenes evaporated
- Chlorophyll not broken down

**How to avoid:**
✅ Control humidity (55-62% RH)
✅ Temperature 64-72°F (18-22°C)
✅ Fan NOT on buds (aim at wall/ceiling)
✅ Dry trim in dry climate

### Mistake 13: Mold During Drying

**Causes:**
- High humidity (>6gt;65% RH)
- Poor air circulation
- Buds touching each other
- Too slow drying (>2gt;21 days)

**Mold signs:**
- White/gray fuzzy growth
- Brown spots inside buds
- Musty ammonia smell

**Consequences:**
❌ **Throw away entire harvest!** Mold dangerous for health.

**How to avoid:**
✅ Humidity 55-62% RH (not higher!)
✅ Ventilation always on
✅ Buds don't touch each other (2-4" apart)
✅ Check daily (smell, look)

### Mistake 14: Didn't Control Drying Conditions

**Problem:**
Didn't know temperature and humidity in drying space.

**Consequences:**
- Too fast or slow drying
- Mold or overdrying

**How to avoid:**
✅ Buy thermohygrometer ($5-15) — ESSENTIAL!
✅ Check T° and RH daily
✅ Adjust conditions (humidifier/dehumidifier)

### Mistake 15: Drying in Light

**Problem:**
Dried in light (window, bright lamp).

**Consequences:**
- THC degradation (-10-30%)
- Terpene loss

**How to avoid:**
✅ Always dry in complete darkness
✅ Or in cardboard box (if no dark place)

### Mistake 16: Overdried

**Signs:**
- Buds crumble to dust
- Very crispy
- Stems snap on light touch

**Consequences:**
- Harsh smoke
- Terpenes evaporated
- Hard to restore

**What to do if overdried:**
1. Put in jar with Boveda 62% for 1-2 weeks
2. Or emergency: piece of orange peel in jar for 2-4 hours (then remove!)

**How to avoid:**
✅ Check stem readiness (snap but don't fall off)
✅ Better slightly underdry than overdry

## Mistakes During Curing

### Mistake 17: Started Curing with Too Wet Buds

**Signs buds too wet:**
- Stems bend, don't snap
- Buds soft, wet to touch
- When squeezed leave wet marks

**Consequences:**
- Mold in jars (100% guaranteed!)
- Anaerobic fermentation (ammonia smell)

**How to avoid:**
✅ Stem test: small stems snap when bent
✅ 24-hour test: put in jar, after 24 hours buds should NOT become wet outside
✅ If became wet → dry another 1-2 days

### Mistake 18: Too Rare Burping First Week

**Problem:**
Opened jars once a day (or less) first week.

**Consequences:**
- Overwetting in jars
- Mold
- Ammonia smell

**How to avoid:**
✅ First week: burping 2-3 times per day for 5-15 minutes
✅ Smell each time: pleasant smell = good, ammonia = problem

### Mistake 19: Packed Jar Too Full

**Problem:**
Filled jar to 95-100% (no air space).

**Consequences:**
- No air circulation
- Buds in center "suffocate"
- Mold

**How to avoid:**
✅ Fill jars to 75-80% maximum
✅ Leave 20-25% empty space

### Mistake 20: Stored Jars in Light

**Problem:**
Left jars on windowsill or table (light).

**Consequences:**
- THC degradation (-10-30% over months)
- Terpene loss

**How to avoid:**
✅ Always store jars in darkness (closet, box)
✅ Open only for burping

### Mistake 21: Didn't Check Jars for Mold

**Problem:**
Put in jars, forgot for 2-4 weeks.

**Consequences:**
- Mold spreads unnoticed
- One moldy bud infects entire jar

**How to avoid:**
✅ Check every jar during burping
✅ Smell: musty smell = mold
✅ Look at buds (especially dense ones)

### Mistake 22: No Boveda Packs

**Problem:**
Didn't use Boveda, controlled humidity manually.

**Risks:**
- Overdrying (if forgot burping)
- Overwetting (if burp rarely)

**Why it happens:**
- "Why spend $5-8 on pack?"
- Didn't know about Boveda

**Recommendation:**
✅ Boveda 62% — best investment in quality ($5-8)
✅ Automatic RH control
✅ Less burping after 2 weeks

**When can skip Boveda:**
If experienced, disciplined, don't skip burping.

## Critical Mistakes That Ruin Entire Harvest

### ⚠️ Mold (Most Dangerous)

**When:**
- During drying (high RH, poor ventilation)
- During curing (too wet buds, rare burping)

**Consequences:**
❌ **Throw away entire harvest!**
❌ Mold dangerous for health (lungs!)

**Prevention:**
✅ Humidity control (thermohygrometer essential)
✅ Burping on schedule
✅ Ventilation always on
✅ Check daily (smell, look)

### ⚠️ Very Fast Drying (<5lt;5 days)

**Consequences:**
- Grassy taste (can't fix!)
- Harsh smoke

**Prevention:**
✅ Control RH 55-62%
✅ Dry trim in dry climate

### ⚠️ Early Harvest (Clear Trichomes)

**Consequences:**
- Weak effect
- Low weight (-30-50%)

**Prevention:**
✅ Always check trichomes!
✅ Better 3 days late

## Growie's Tip

Two main mistakes that ruin everything: **mold** and **too fast drying**. Buy thermohygrometer for $10 and control conditions daily — it will save your harvest! Don't rush: better to dry longer (10-14 days) than fast (5 days). Use Boveda 62% for curing — $5-8 will save months of work from mold. Always check trichomes before harvest (don't guess by calendar!) — $5 loupe pays off in first cycle. In Growie record all mistakes and successes: what conditions were, what went wrong — next cycle will be perfect! And remember: if smells like ammonia or see mold — immediately open jars and act, don't wait!
