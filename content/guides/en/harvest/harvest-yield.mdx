# Harvest Yield: How to Increase and Calculate Properly

![Weighing harvest](/images/guides/harvest-yield.jpg)

Yield is one of the main indicators of successful growing. Let's break down how to calculate properly, what's considered a good result, and how to increase yield in future cycles.

## Yield Measurement Units

### 1. Grams per Watt (g/W)

**What it is:**
How many grams of dry buds obtained per 1 watt of light power.

**Formula:**
```
g/W = Yield (g) / Light Power (W)
```

**Example:**
- Yield: 300 g
- Light: 300W LED
- g/W = 300 / 300 = **1.0 g/W**

**Average Metrics:**

| Level | g/W (LED) | g/W (HPS) |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Beginner | 0.3-0.5 | 0.4-0.6 |
| Intermediate | 0.6-0.8 | 0.7-0.9 |
| Experienced | 0.9-1.2 | 1.0-1.3 |
| Master | 1.3-1.8 | 1.4-2.0 |
| Record | &gt;2.0 | &gt;2.5 |

**Important:** LED more efficient → lower g/W, but cheaper electricity.

### 2. Grams per Square Meter (g/m²)

**What it is:**
How many grams yield from 1 m² (10.76 sq ft) grow area.

**Formula:**
```
g/m² = Yield (g) / Area (m²)
```

**Example:**
- Yield: 400 g
- Tent: 4×4' = 1.44 m²
- g/m² = 400 / 1.44 = **277 g/m²**

**Average Metrics:**

| Level | g/m² |
|-------|------|
| Beginner | 150-250 |
| Intermediate | 250-400 |
| Experienced | 400-600 |
| Master | 600-800 |
| Record | &gt;800 |

### 3. Grams per Plant (g/plant)

**What it is:**
How many grams from one plant.

**Average Metrics:**

| Method | g/plant |
|--------|---------|
| 1 plant SOG (small) | 20-40 (0.7-1.4 oz) |
| 4 plants SOG | 50-100 (1.7-3.5 oz) |
| 1 plant SCROG | 100-300 (3.5-10.5 oz) |
| Outdoor (large) | 500-2000 (17-70 oz) |
| Autoflowers (indoor) | 30-100 (1-3.5 oz) |

**Important:** Depends on plant size, not always indicative.

## Factors Affecting Yield

### 1. Light (Main Factor)

**Why important:**
Light → photosynthesis → growth → yield.

**Light Power:**

| Area | LED | HPS | Expected Yield |
|------|-----|-----|----------------|
| 2×2' (0.36m²) | 150-200W | 250W | 150-250 g (5-9 oz) |
| 2.5×2.5' (0.64m²) | 250-320W | 400W | 250-400 g (9-14 oz) |
| 3×3' (1m²) | 400-480W | 600W | 400-600 g (14-21 oz) |
| 4×4' (1.44m²) | 600-720W | 1000W | 600-900 g (21-32 oz) |

**How to increase:**
✅ Use sufficient light power (minimum 300W LED per m²)
✅ Proper distance from lamps (8-16" for LED, 16-24" for HPS)
✅ Full spectrum LED (better for yield)

### 2. Genetics

**Impact:**
High-yielding strains can give 2-3x more than low-yielding.

**High-Yielding Strains:**
- Big Bud
- Critical Mass
- Northern Lights
- White Widow
- Most XXL autoflowers

**Low-Yielding Strains:**
- Landrace sativas
- Some OG Kush phenotypes
- Specialty strains (focused on taste/effect, not yield)

**How to increase:**
✅ Choose proven high-yielding strains
✅ Read breeder descriptions (Indoor yield: XXX g/m²)

### 3. Nutrition

**Impact:**
Underfeeding = small buds, overfeeding = burn (stress) → reduced yield.

**Optimal Nutrition:**

**Vegetative:**
- N-P-K with emphasis on N (nitrogen)
- Start with 1/4 dose, gradually increase to full

**Flowering:**
- N-P-K with emphasis on P and K (phosphorus, potassium)
- Bloom booster last 3-4 weeks

**How to increase:**
✅ Use quality nutrients (not cheapest)
✅ Follow manufacturer feeding schedule (don't reinvent)
✅ Control pH: 6.0-6.5 (soil), 5.5-6.0 (hydro/coco)
✅ Add Cal-Mag if using LED

### 4. Plant Training

**Impact:**
Proper training increases yield by 30-50%.

**Methods:**

**LST (Low Stress Training):**
- Bend branches, increase canopy area
- More light on all buds
- **+20-30% yield**

**SCROG (Screen of Green):**
- Net over plants
- All buds at same height
- **+30-50% yield**

**Topping/FIM:**
- Cut top → multiple main colas
- More large buds
- **+20-40% yield**

**Defoliation:**
- Remove large leaves
- More light penetrates down
- **+10-20% yield** (if done right!)

**How to increase:**
✅ Use minimum LST for all plants
✅ SCROG for maximum yield (1-4 plants)
✅ Topping during veg (2-3 times)

### 5. Vegetative Duration

**Impact:**
Longer veg → bigger plant → bigger yield.

**Recommendations:**

| Method | Veg | Result |
|--------|-----|--------|
| SOG (many small) | 1-2 weeks | 20-40 g/plant (0.7-1.4 oz) |
| Regular (4 plants) | 4-6 weeks | 80-150 g/plant (2.8-5.3 oz) |
| SCROG (1-2 plants) | 6-10 weeks | 200-400 g/plant (7-14 oz) |

**How to increase:**
✅ Give more time for veg (minimum 4-6 weeks)
✅ For SCROG: 6-8 weeks veg

### 6. Conditions (Temperature, Humidity, CO₂)

**Optimal Conditions:**

| Parameter | Vegetative | Flowering |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Temperature | 72-82°F (22-28°C) | 68-79°F (20-26°C) |
| Humidity | 50-70% | 40-50% |
| CO₂ | 400 ppm (normal air) | 400-1200 ppm |

**CO₂ (optional):**
- Adding CO₂ to 1000-1500 ppm
- **+20-40% yield**
- But expensive ($500-1500 for system)

**How to increase:**
✅ Maintain optimal temperature and humidity
✅ CO₂ — only for experienced (need sealed tent)

### 7. Substrate

**Impact:**
Good substrate = healthy roots = bigger yield.

**Substrate Types:**

| Substrate | Difficulty | Yield (relative) |
|-----------|------------|------------------|
| Soil (quality) | Easy | 100% (baseline) |
| Coco | Medium | 110-130% |
| Hydroponics | Hard | 120-150% |
| Aeroponics | Very Hard | 130-160% |

**How to increase:**
✅ Use quality soil (not garden soil!)
✅ Try coco (easier than hydro, higher yield than soil)
✅ Hydro for experienced (maximum yield)

### 8. Pot Size

**Impact:**
Small pot = root limitation = small plant.

**Recommendations:**

| Pot Size | Plant Size | Yield/Plant |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| 0.8-1.3 gal (3-5 L) | Small (SOG) | 20-40 g (0.7-1.4 oz) |
| 1.8-2.9 gal (7-11 L) | Medium | 50-100 g (1.7-3.5 oz) |
| 4-5.3 gal (15-20 L) | Large | 100-200 g (3.5-7 oz) |
| 8+ gal (30+ L) | Very Large | 200-400+ g (7-14+ oz) |

**How to increase:**
✅ Minimum 3 gal (11L) for average grow
✅ 4-5 gal (15-20L) for SCROG

### 9. Staged Harvest

**Impact:**
Tops mature earlier → if cut them, bottom buds get more light → mature → **+10-20% yield**.

**How:**
1. Cut top 30-40% when ready
2. After 5-7 days cut middle tier
3. After 5-7 days cut bottom

**How to increase:**
✅ Always use staged harvest

## Growie's Tip

Don't chase yield records in first cycles — first learn to grow healthy plants! 0.6-0.8 g/W for beginner is excellent result. Main yield factors: light (minimum 300W LED/m²), long veg (6-8 weeks), and training (at least LST). Everything else gives +10-20%, but these three give +100-200%! Keep diary in Growie: record yield each cycle, conditions, what you did — after 3-4 cycles you'll understand your ideal system. And remember: one SCROG plant can give as much as 4-6 untrained plants — train your plants!
