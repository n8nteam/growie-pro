# Harvest Process: Technique and Tools

![Harvest process](/images/guides/harvest-process.jpg)

Harvesting is the culmination of months of work. Proper harvest technique affects quality, preservation, and further processing. Let's break down the entire process step by step.

## Preparing for Harvest

### Flush (Pre-harvest Cleanse) — 7-14 days before harvest

**What it is:**
Stopping nutrient feeding and watering with clean water to flush out mineral residues from the plant.

**Why it's needed:**
- Improves taste (removes "chemical" aftertaste)
- Smoke becomes smoother
- Ash is white (not black)
- Plant uses reserves from leaves (yellowing is normal!)

#### How to Flush

**1. In Soil/Coco:**
- 7-10 days before harvest
- Water with clean water (pH 6.0-6.5)
- Volume: 2-3x pot volume (2.5 gal pot = 5-7.5 gal water)
- Repeat every 2-3 days

**2. In Hydro:**
- 3-5 days before harvest
- Change solution to clean water
- Maintain pH 5.8-6.2
- Change water daily

**3. In Organic (living soil):**
- Flush optional
- Or light flush 3-5 days out

#### Signs of Proper Flush

✅ Fan leaves yellowing (bottom first)
✅ Plant "starving", giving reserves to buds
✅ Sugar leaves still green
✅ Buds continue maturing

### Last Watering

**24-48 hours before harvest:**
- Stop watering completely
- Let soil dry (not completely!)
- Plant will start using moisture from leaves

**Why:**
- Speeds up drying
- Reduces mold risk
- Plant will be lighter

**Important:** Don't dry soil completely — plant shouldn't wilt!

### Darkness Before Harvest

**Optional method:**
Keep plant in complete darkness 24-72 hours before harvest.

**Theory:**
Without light, plant produces more terpenes and cannabinoids (defense reaction).

**Practice:**
- Research doesn't confirm significant increase
- But many growers notice stronger smell
- Minimal risks

**How to do:**
- Turn off light 24-48 hours before harvest
- Complete darkness (no green lights!)
- Maintain ventilation

**Recommendation:** Try on one plant, evaluate result.

## Harvest Tools

### Essential Tools

#### 1. Pruners

**What you need:**
- Sharp pruners for branches (up to 0.5-0.75" diameter)
- Small trimming scissors for manicuring

**Recommendations:**
- Fiskars P68 pruner ($15-20) — sharp, light
- Chikamasa scissors ($20-30) — best for trimming
- Budget: AliExpress scissors ($5-10)

**Important:** Tools must be **sharp**! Dull scissors crush plant material.

#### 2. Gloves

**Why:**
- Trichomes very sticky (hands become resin)
- Hand protection from plant juice (can irritate)
- Hygiene

**Which:**
- Nitrile or latex (disposable)
- Or trimming gloves (reusable)

#### 3. Trays/Containers

**For:**
- Folding cut branches
- Collecting trimmed leaves
- Collecting trichomes (kief falling during trimming)

**Recommendations:**
- Plastic trays ($5-10)
- Or cardboard boxes

#### 4. Drying Lines/Racks

**Types:**
- **Line + clips** — for hanging branches
- **Drying rack** — for laid out buds

**When to buy:** Before harvest, so it's ready!

### Optional Tools

#### 5. Trimming Machine

**When needed:**
- Large harvest (>1gt;1 lb / 500g)
- No time for hand trimming
- Commercial production

**Pros:**
- Fast (10-20x faster)

**Cons:**
- Expensive ($200-2000)
- Damages trichomes
- Result worse than hand trim

**Popular models:**
- TrimBin ($50) — not a machine, but convenient tray with screen
- iPower Leaf Bowl Trimmer ($170-200) — budget manual
- Centurion Pro ($1500-3000) — professional

#### 6. Trim Tray with Screen (Trim Bin)

**What it is:**
Tray with fine screen on bottom — trichomes fall down, leaves stay on top.

**Price:** $40-60

**Alternative:** DIY (stretch screen over frame).

## Harvesting Techniques

### Method 1: Cut Whole Plant

**How:**
1. Cut plant at stem base (above soil)
2. Hang whole plant upside down

**Pros:**
- Quick
- Slow drying (good for quality)
- Convenient for small plants

**Cons:**
- Need lots of space
- Hard to control drying

**When to use:**
- Small plants (1-2)
- Have space to hang whole
- Want slow drying (7-14 days)

### Method 2: Cut by Branches

**How:**
1. Cut branches separately (8-16" length)
2. Hang on line

**Pros:**
- Flexibility (can adjust size)
- Easier to place
- Easier to control drying

**Cons:**
- Takes slightly longer

**When to use:**
- Medium/large plants
- Limited space
- Standard method for most

### Method 3: Cut by Buds

**How:**
1. Cut buds from branches
2. Lay on drying rack

**Pros:**
- Compact
- Fast drying

**Cons:**
- Very fast drying (may overdry)
- Requires rack
- Need to turn buds

**When to use:**
- Very humid climate (mold risk)
- Little space
- Need fast drying (5-7 days)

## Step-by-Step Harvest Process

### Step 1: Space Preparation

**Day before harvest:**
1. Prepare work table
2. Lay out tools, gloves, trays
3. Prepare drying space (lines/racks)
4. Turn on ventilation in drying space

### Step 2: Cutting Plant

**Harvest morning:**

1. **Turn off light** (if doing 24-48h darkness)
2. **Put on gloves**
3. **Cut:**
   - Whole: one cut at base
   - By branches: bottom to top, leave 2-4" from stem

**Tip:** Cut in morning (before lights on) — terpene levels higher.

### Step 3: Removing Large Fan Leaves

**Right after cutting:**
1. Remove large fan leaves without trichomes
2. Leave sugar leaves (with trichomes) — trim later

**Goal:** Ease drying, remove excess mass.

### Step 4: Hanging to Dry

**Right after leaf removal:**

1. Hang branches/plant upside down on line
2. Or lay buds on drying rack

**Important:**
- Buds shouldn't touch each other
- Good air circulation
- Temperature 64-72°F (18-22°C), humidity 55-62%

## Staged Harvest

### Why Harvest in Stages?

**Problem:**
Top buds mature 5-7 days earlier than bottom ones (more light).

**Solution:**
Harvest in 2-3 stages.

### How to Do Staged Harvest

**Stage 1: Tops (Week 0)**

1. Check trichomes on tops
2. If ready (70-80% cloudy + 20-30% amber):
   - Cut top 30-40% of plant
   - Hang to dry

**Stage 2: Mid Level (Week +0.5-1)**

3. After 5-7 days check middle buds
4. If ready → cut middle tier

**Stage 3: Bottom (Week +1-1.5)**

5. Another 5-7 days later harvest bottom buds

**Result:**
- Each part harvested at peak maturity
- Yield +10-20% from bottom buds (they mature!)
- More uniform quality

### Staged Harvest Table

| Level | When to Cut | Result |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Tops | At 70-80% cloudy trichomes | Peak maturity |
| Middle | +5-7 days after tops | Mature, bigger weight |
| Bottom | +5-7 days after middle | Matured, +10-20% yield |

## Growie's Tip

Buy a thermohygrometer for $10 — it's the best investment in harvest quality! Maintain temperature 64-72°F (18-22°C) and humidity 55-62%, and your drying will be perfect. Main rule: better to dry slowly (10-14 days) than quickly. If doubting ready or not — dry another 2-3 days, won't hurt. Always use dry trim in dry climate and wet trim in humid. In Growie record drying conditions daily (temperature, RH, bud state) — you'll understand ideal duration for your conditions. And remember: mold = throw away entire harvest, so don't ignore circulation and humidity control!
