# Trimming (Manicuring): Wet vs Dry Trim

![Trimming buds](/images/guides/trimming.jpg)

Trimming (removing sugar leaves) is one of the longest but most important post-harvest stages. Proper technique makes buds beautiful, improves smoking, and preserves maximum trichomes. Let's break down all methods.

## What Is Trimming

**Trimming (manicuring)** — removing sugar leaves from buds after harvest.

**Goal:**
- Improve appearance
- Remove excess plant material
- Make buds dense
- Improve smoking (leaves burn worse)

**What we remove:**
- **Sugar leaves** — small leaves sticking out of buds, covered in trichomes

**What we keep:**
- **Calyxes** — the buds themselves, flowers
- Some leave a bit of sugar leaves (for trichome protection)

## Wet Trim vs Dry Trim

### Wet Trim

**When to do:**
Right after cutting plant, while still "wet" (fresh).

**Process:**
1. Cut plant
2. Removed large fan leaves
3. Immediately trimmed sugar leaves
4. Hung ready buds to dry

**Pros:**
✅ Easier to cut (leaves stick out, not stuck)
✅ Faster drying (5-7 days instead of 10-14)
✅ Less mold risk (in humid climate)
✅ Saves space (buds more compact)
✅ Ready buds right after drying

**Cons:**
❌ Fast drying can worsen taste
❌ More terpenes evaporate
❌ Buds can become too dry outside
❌ Process unforgiving of mistakes

**When to use:**
- Humid climate (>65% RH)
- Mold risk
- Little drying space
- Want fast drying
- Commercial grows (appearance important)

### Dry Trim

**When to do:**
After drying branches (7-14 days after harvest).

**Process:**
1. Cut plant
2. Removed large fan leaves
3. Hung branches with sugar leaves to dry
4. After 7-14 days trimmed dry sugar leaves

**Pros:**
✅ Slow drying = better taste
✅ Terpenes preserve better
✅ Buds protected by leaves (less trichome damage)
✅ More even drying
✅ Process forgiving of mistakes

**Cons:**
❌ Harder to cut (leaves stuck to buds)
❌ Long process (10-14 day dry)
❌ Need more space
❌ Mold risk in humid climate
❌ Bud appearance slightly worse

**When to use:**
- Dry climate (<55% RH)
- Quality more important than appearance
- Enough drying space
- Personal use (not for sale)
- Want best taste

### Comparison Table

| Parameter | Wet Trim | Dry Trim |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **When to trim** | Right after cutting | After drying (7-14 days) |
| **Drying speed** | 5-7 days | 10-14 days |
| **Taste** | Good | Excellent |
| **Terpenes** | More evaporation | Better preserved |
| **Trim ease** | Easy | Harder |
| **Appearance** | Beautiful, dense | Slightly less neat |
| **Mold risk** | Lower | Higher |
| **Drying space** | Less | More |
| **For humid climate** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **For dry climate** | ❌ May overdry | ✅ Yes |

### Hybrid Method

**How to do:**
1. Remove large fan leaves immediately
2. Trim sticking sugar leaf tips (but not completely)
3. Dry with partially trimmed leaves 7-10 days
4. After drying do final trim

**Pros:**
- Balance between speed and quality
- Trichome protection + moderate drying

## Trimming Tools

### Gloves

**Types:**

**Why:**
Hands covered in resin in 10 minutes → scissors stick → trimming becomes hell.

### Trays and Accessories

Tray with fine screen — trichomes fall down (kief), leaves stay on top.

**Alternative:**
Regular tray + screen stretched over frame (DIY).

#### Bowl Trimmer

**Price:** $150-250

**How it works:**
Put buds in rotating bowl with blades → leaves get trimmed.

**Pros:**
- Fast (10-20x faster than hand)

**Cons:**
- Damages trichomes
- Less neat
- Buds lose shape

**When to use:**
Commercial grows, large harvests, trim for extracts.

## Growie's Tip

Choose trimming method for your climate: in humid (>65% RH) do wet trim, in dry (<55% RH) — must do dry trim! Don't skimp on scissors — buy Chikamasa for $25 once and they'll last years. Clean scissors with alcohol every 20 minutes, otherwise trimming becomes torture. And most important: **don't throw away trim!** Sugar leaves can become great bubble hash or cannabutter. In Growie you can record how much trim you got and what you made from it — next cycle you'll plan better. Turn on music, invite friends and enjoy the process — it's meditation after months of growing!
