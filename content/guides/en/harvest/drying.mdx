# Drying Your Harvest: Conditions and Methods

![Drying buds](/images/guides/drying-buds.jpg)

Drying is a critical stage that determines taste, aroma, and smoking quality. Poor drying can ruin months of work. Slow, controlled drying is the key to excellent taste.

## Why Proper Drying Matters

### What Happens During Drying

**Processes:**
1. **Moisture evaporation** — water leaves buds (75% → 10-15%)
2. **Chlorophyll breakdown** — "green" grassy taste disappears
3. **Terpene transformation** — aroma becomes more complex
4. **Cannabinoid degradation** — minimal (if done right)

### Consequences of Improper Drying

#### Too Fast Drying (<5lt;5 days)

**Consequences:**
- Grassy "hay" smell (hay smell)
- Terpenes evaporated → weak aroma
- Chlorophyll not broken down → green taste
- Harsh smoke (throat irritation)
- Buds dry outside, wet inside

#### Too Slow Drying (>2gt;21 days)

**Consequences:**
- Mold (especially inside dense buds)
- Terpene loss (evaporated completely)
- Cannabinoid degradation

#### Uneven Drying

**Consequences:**
- Outside crispy, inside wet
- Mold during storage
- Impossible to cure properly

### Ideal Drying

**Characteristics:**
- Duration: 7-14 days
- Even (inside and outside same)
- Slow (controlled)
- At stable conditions

**Result:**
✅ Excellent taste and aroma
✅ Smooth smoke
✅ Chlorophyll broken down
✅ Terpenes preserved
✅ Ready for curing

## Optimal Drying Conditions

### Temperature

**Ideal:** 64-72°F (18-22°C)

**Acceptable:** 59-75°F (15-24°C)

**Why:**
- &lt;59°F (15°C) — too slow drying, mold risk
- &gt;75°F (24°C) — fast drying, terpene evaporation

**Stability:** Important! Temperature swings speed up/slow down drying unevenly.

### Humidity (RH)

**Ideal:** 55-62% RH

**Acceptable:**
- 50-55% — slightly faster (for humid climate)
- 60-65% — slower (for dry climate)

**Critical zones:**
- &lt;45% RH — too fast, terpenes evaporate
- &gt;70% RH — mold guaranteed

**Stability:** Critical! RH fluctuations = uneven drying.

### Air Circulation

**Why:**
- Prevents mold
- Ensures even drying
- Carries away evaporated moisture

**How:**
- Fan on low speed
- **Important:** Don't aim directly at buds!
- Blow on walls/ceiling, create circulation

**Fan speed:**
- Small space (2×2' tent): fan on minimum
- Large room: regular fan on medium speed

### Darkness

**Why:**
- Light destroys THC and terpenes
- UV rays degrade cannabinoids

**How:**
- Complete darkness (grow tent with closed flaps)
- Or very dim light (only for checking)

**If no dark place:**
Use cardboard boxes with holes for circulation.

### Conditions Table

| Parameter | Ideal | Acceptable | Critical |
|-----------|-------|------------|----------|
| **Temperature** | 64-72°F (18-22°C) | 59-75°F (15-24°C) | &lt;59°F or &gt;79°F |
| **Humidity** | 55-62% | 50-65% | &lt;45% or &gt;70% |
| **Circulation** | Low, constant | Medium | None or directly on buds |
| **Light** | Complete darkness | Dim light | Bright light |
| **Duration** | 10-14 days | 7-18 days | &lt;5 or &gt;21 days |

## Drying Methods

### Method 1: Hanging Branches Upside Down (Most Popular)

**How:**
1. String lines/wire in grow tent or room
2. Hang branches upside down on line
3. Use clips or hooks

**Branch size:**
- Whole plant (small plants)
- 8-16" branches (medium/large plants)

**Space between branches:**
Minimum 2-4", buds shouldn't touch each other.

**Pros:**
✅ Simple and reliable
✅ Even drying
✅ Gravity helps (moisture leaves evenly)
✅ Good circulation around buds

**Cons:**
❌ Need vertical space
❌ Need height (24-40")

**For whom:**
Most growers, standard method.

### Method 2: Drying Rack

**What it is:**
Horizontal mesh with multiple tiers for laying out buds.

**How:**
1. Lay buds (after wet trim) on rack tiers
2. Don't pack tightly (leave space)
3. Turn buds once a day

**Pros:**
✅ Compact (saves vertical space)
✅ Good for small spaces
✅ Easy to check readiness

**Cons:**
❌ Fast drying (5-7 days)
❌ Need to turn buds
❌ Screen marks on buds (bottom side)
❌ Worse for quality (terpenes evaporate faster)

**For whom:**
- Humid climate (mold risk)
- Small spaces
- Wet trim

### Method 3: Whole Plant Upside Down

**How:**
1. Cut whole plant (at stem base)
2. Remove only large fan leaves
3. Hang entire plant upside down on one hook

**Pros:**
✅ Slowest drying (10-21 days)
✅ Best taste (terpenes preserved maximally)
✅ Dry trim (leaves protect trichomes)

**Cons:**
❌ Need lots of space
❌ Mold risk in humid climate
❌ Uneven drying (bottom dries slower)

**For whom:**
- Dry climate (<5lt;50% RH)
- Enough space
- Quality — priority

### Method 4: Cardboard Box (Budget)

**How:**
1. Take large cardboard box
2. Cut holes in sides/top (for circulation)
3. String lines inside or lay buds on bottom
4. Close box (not hermetically!)

**Pros:**
✅ Free
✅ Darkness
✅ Portable (can hide)

**Cons:**
❌ Weak circulation → mold risk
❌ Hard to control conditions
❌ Cardboard absorbs moisture

**For whom:**
Emergency option when no tent/room.

### Method 5: Dehydrator (Not Recommended)

**How:**
Put buds in food dehydrator.

**Settings:**
- Minimum temperature (<8lt;86°F / 30°C)
- 2-4 days

**Pros:**
✅ Fast

**Cons:**
❌ Terrible taste (terpenes evaporate)
❌ Chlorophyll not broken down
❌ Uneven drying

**For whom:**
❌ Nobody. Use only in emergency (fast drying needed).

## Drying Duration

### Factors Affecting Speed

1. **Bud size:**
   - Small (< 0.1 oz / 3g) — 5-7 days
   - Medium (0.1-0.25 oz / 3-7g) — 7-10 days
   - Large (>0gt;0.35 oz / 10g) — 10-14 days

2. **Bud density:**
   - Airy (sativa) — faster
   - Dense (indica) — slower

3. **Trim method:**
   - Wet trim — faster (5-7 days)
   - Dry trim — slower (10-14 days)

4. **Conditions:**
   - Low humidity — faster
   - High humidity — slower

### Duration Table

| Method | Conditions | Duration |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Wet trim, branches | 55-60% RH, 68°F (20°C) | 7-10 days |
| Dry trim, branches | 55-60% RH, 68°F (20°C) | 10-14 days |
| Whole plant | 55-60% RH, 68°F (20°C) | 14-21 days |
| Rack, buds | 50-55% RH, 68°F (20°C) | 5-7 days |

## Growie's Tip

Buy a thermohygrometer for $10 — it's the best investment in harvest quality! Keep temperature 64-72°F (18-22°C) and humidity 55-62%, and your drying will be perfect. Main rule: better to dry slowly (10-14 days) than fast (5 days). If doubting ready or not — dry another 2-3 days, won't hurt. Always use dry trim in dry climate and wet trim in humid. In Growie record drying conditions daily (temperature, RH, bud state) — you'll understand ideal duration for your conditions. And remember: mold = throw away entire harvest, so don't ignore circulation and humidity control!
