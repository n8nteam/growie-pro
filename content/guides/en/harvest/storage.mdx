# Long-Term Storage of Your Harvest

![Storage in jars](/images/guides/storage-jars.jpg)

After curing, it's important to store harvest properly so it doesn't lose quality. Proper storage preserves THC, terpenes, taste, and aroma for months or even years. Let's break down all methods.

## Enemies of Long-Term Storage

### 1. Light (Main Enemy)

**What happens:**
- UV rays destroy THC
- THC → CBN (cannabinol, sedative effect)
- Degradation: -10-30% THC over 6-12 months in light

**Solution:**
Complete darkness always.

### 2. Temperature

**High temperature (>7gt;77°F / 25°C):**
- Terpenes evaporate (aroma loss)
- Accelerated cannabinoid degradation
- Mold risk (if humidity high)

**Very low (<&lt;32°F / 0°C long-term):**
- Trichomes become brittle and fall off
- Can store in freezer, but only vacuum sealed (see below)

**Optimal:** 64-72°F (18-22°C) room temperature

### 3. Humidity

**High (>6gt;65% RH):**
- Mold
- Rot

**Low (<5lt;55% RH):**
- Overdrying
- Buds crumble
- Terpenes evaporate
- Harsh smoke

**Optimal:** 58-62% RH

### 4. Oxygen (Oxidation)

**What happens:**
- Cannabinoids oxidize
- Terpenes degrade
- THC → CBN
- Potency loss (~5% per year)

**Solution:**
Airtight containers, minimize air.

### 5. Physical Damage

**What happens:**
- Trichomes break from touching, shaking
- Cannabinoid loss

**Solution:**
Don't touch buds unnecessarily, store carefully.

## Ideal Storage Conditions

### Temperature

**Short-term (1-3 months):**
64-72°F (18-22°C) room temperature — fine.

**Long-term (3-12 months):**
59-64°F (15-18°C) cool place — better.

**Very long-term (>1gt;12 months):**
Freezing 0°F (-18°C) vacuum sealed.

### Humidity

**With control (Boveda):**
58-62% RH — ideal.

**Without control:**
Store in airtight jars in dry place (room 40-50% RH).

### Light

Complete darkness always.

### Containers

Airtight, glass or opaque.

## Storage Containers

### 1. Glass Jars (Best for &lt;12 months)

**Types:**
- Mason jars (Ball, Kerr)
- Jars with rubber seal
- Regular glass with screw lid

**Pros:**
✅ Airtight
✅ Don't absorb smells
✅ Can see contents
✅ Cheap, reusable

**Cons:**
❌ Let light through (store in dark!)
❌ Fragile

**How to use:**
1. Fill to 75-80% (leave some air)
2. Add Boveda 58% or 62%
3. Close tight
4. Store in closet/box (darkness)

### 2. CVault / Metal Containers

**What it is:**
Opaque metal containers with airtight lid.

**Price:** $20-40

**Pros:**
✅ Don't let light through
✅ Airtight
✅ Design for Boveda pack
✅ Durable

**Cons:**
❌ Expensive
❌ Can't see contents without opening

### 3. Infinity Jars (Purple Glass)

**What it is:**
Purple glass jars (Miron glass) — block all light except violet and infrared.

**Price:** $20-50

**Pros:**
✅ Light protection (best)
✅ Glass (don't absorb smells)
✅ Look beautiful

**Cons:**
❌ Expensive
❌ Fragile

**Worth it:**
If storing long (>1gt;12 months) and budget allows — yes.

### 4. Vacuum Bags (For Freezing)

**When to use:**
Long-term storage (>1gt;12 months) in freezer.

**How:**
1. Vacuum seal buds (FoodSaver or similar)
2. Double bag (second bag over first)
3. In freezer 0°F (-18°C)

**Pros:**
✅ Long storage (years!)
✅ Minimal oxidation
✅ Moisture protection

**Cons:**
❌ Trichomes brittle when frozen (fall off when thawing)
❌ Need equipment
❌ Can't take out often (condensation)

### 5. Plastic Containers

**When to use:**
❌ Not recommended!

**Why:**
- Plastic absorbs terpenes
- Static electricity (trichomes stick)
- Not airtight

## Storage Methods

### Method 1: Standard Storage (up to 12 months)

**For whom:**
Most growers, personal use.

**Process:**

1. **After curing (4-8 weeks):**
   - Transfer buds to clean glass jars
   - Add Boveda 58% (for long storage)
   - Fill to 75-80%
   - Close tight

2. **Store:**
   - In closet/box (darkness)
   - Room temperature (64-72°F / 18-22°C)
   - Dry place

3. **Check:**
   - Open once a month for 5 minutes (air refresh)
   - Smell, look (mold?)
   - Change Boveda every 4-6 months

**Result:**
Buds maintain quality 6-12 months.

### Method 2: Refrigerator (Controversial)

**Pros:**
- Low temperature (slows degradation)
- Darkness

**Cons:**
- High humidity (condensation!)
- Food smells (can absorb)
- Frequent fridge opening (temperature swings)

**If using refrigerator:**
1. Airtight jar
2. Boveda 58%
3. In separate container (smell protection)
4. Don't open often (condensation on buds)

**Recommendation:**
Cool room (59-64°F / 15-18°C) better than refrigerator.

### Method 3: Freezing (Very Long Storage &gt;12 months)

**For whom:**
- Large harvest (want to preserve part for years)
- Rare/valuable strains

**Process:**

1. **Preparation:**
   - Buds must be dry (60-62% RH)
   - Cured minimum 4 weeks

2. **Packing:**
   - Vacuum seal in bags (FoodSaver)
   - Or glass jar + double bag (remove air)
   - Double packing (condensation protection)

3. **Freezing:**
   - In freezer 0°F (-18°C)
   - In coldest corner (not door!)

4. **Thawing (when needed):**
   - DON'T open immediately!
   - Put jar/bag in room
   - Wait 2-4 hours (until room temperature)
   - Then open (otherwise condensation!)

**Important:**
❌ Don't freeze/thaw multiple times (destroys trichomes)
❌ Only take out what you'll smoke in coming weeks

**Result:**
Storage 1-3 years with minimal degradation.

## Boveda: 58% vs 62% for Storage

### Boveda 62% RH

**When to use:**
- Curing (first 4-8 weeks)
- Storage up to 6 months
- If smoking regularly (opening often)

**Pros:**
✅ Buds softer, easier to break
✅ More terpenes (aroma brighter)

**Cons:**
❌ Risk of overwetting (if opening rarely)

### Boveda 58% RH

**When to use:**
- Long-term storage (>6gt;6 months)
- Rarely open jar
- Hot/humid climate

**Pros:**
✅ Less mold risk
✅ Buds more stable during long storage

**Cons:**
❌ Buds slightly drier (some don't like)

### Recommendation

| Storage Duration | Boveda | Reason |
|------------------|--------|---------|
| 0-6 months | 62% | Optimal humidity for smoking |
| 6-12 months | 58% | More stable, less problem risk |
| &gt;12 months | 58% or freezing | Long term, safety more important |

## Growie's Tip

Buy quality Mason jars and Boveda 58% — that's all you need for excellent storage up to a year! Store in closet (darkness + room temp), check once a month, change Boveda every 4-6 months. If large harvest (>1gt;1 lb / 500g) — part for smoking in small jars, rest vacuum seal and freeze. In Growie keep inventory: which strain, how much left, when harvested — won't forget old jars in closet! And remember: 80% of THC degradation comes from light and high temperature — put buds in dark closet and will be perfect!
