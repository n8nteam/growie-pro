# Choosing an Exhaust Fan for Grow Box

![Inline fan in grow box](/images/guides/exhaust-fans.jpg)

The exhaust fan is the heart of the ventilation system. The right choice determines temperature, humidity, air exchange, and odor control in your grow box.

## Fan Types

### Inline (Duct) Fans

**Most popular type for grow boxes**

**Pros**:
- Built into ducting
- Compact, easy to mount
- Quiet when properly installed
- Easy to connect filter

**Cons**:
- Higher price than axial
- Require speed controller to reduce noise

**Best Brands**:
- AC Infinity (CloudLine series) — recommended
- Vents (TT, TT PRO)
- Soler & Palau TD-Silent
- Systemair RVK

### Centrifugal (Radial) Fans

**For professional and large installations**

**Pros**:
- Very powerful (high static pressure)
- Work better with long ducts and filters
- Reliable, industrial quality

**Cons**:
- Expensive ($200-500+)
- Bulky
- Noisy without silencers

**When to Use**:
- Tents larger than 6'×6'
- Long ducting (>1gt;10 feet)
- Multiple filters in system

### Axial Fans

**Not recommended for exhaust**

**Why**:
- Low static pressure
- Can't push air through filter
- Very noisy

**Where to Use**:
- Only for internal circulation
- For intake (without filter)

## CFM Calculation

### Calculation Formula

```
CFM = (Length × Width × Height) × Exchange Rate / 60
```

**Example for 39"×39"×79" tent**:
- Volume: 3.25' × 3.25' × 6.6' = 70 cubic feet
- Exchange rate: 60 exchanges per hour (standard)
- CFM: 70 × 60 / 60 = **70 CFM**

### Adjustment Coefficients

Add power reserve for:

| Factor | Coefficient |
|--------|-------------|
| Carbon filter | +25-30% |
| Ducting &gt;6 feet | +15% per 3 feet |
| Ducting bends | +10% per 90° turn |
| HPS/HID lighting | +20% |
| Hot climate (>8gt;86°F) | +30% |

**Final Calculation**:
- Base CFM: 70
- With filter: 70 × 1.3 = 91
- Ducting 10 ft: 91 × 1.15 = 105
- Two bends: 105 × 1.2 = **126 CFM**

Conclusion: for 39"×39"×79" tent with filter need **120-150 CFM** fan.

## Recommendations by Tent Size

### Small Boxes (24"×24", 32"×32")

**Volume**: 20-40 ft³
**Fan**: 100-150 CFM (4"/100mm diameter)
**Models**:
- AC Infinity CloudLine S4 (205 CFM)
- Vents TT 100 (145 CFM)
- Hon&Guan 4" (190 CFM)

### Medium Boxes (39"×39", 47"×47")

**Volume**: 70-100 ft³
**Fan**: 200-350 CFM (6"/150mm diameter)
**Models**:
- AC Infinity CloudLine S6 (402 CFM)
- Vents TT 150 (340 CFM)
- Soler & Palau TD-350 (345 CFM)

### Large Boxes (59"×59", 6'×6')

**Volume**: 140-280 ft³
**Fan**: 400-700 CFM (8"/200mm diameter)
**Models**:
- AC Infinity CloudLine T8 (740 CFM)
- Vents TT PRO 200 (830 CFM)
- Systemair RVK 200 (820 CFM)

## Fan Specifications

### Noise Level

Measured in decibels (dB):

- **&lt;30 dB** — very quiet, like whisper
- **30-40 dB** — quiet, like background noise
- **40-50 dB** — noticeable, like quiet conversation
- **&gt;50 dB** — loud, interferes with sleep

**Ways to Reduce Noise**:
- Speed controller (reduce to 60-70%)
- Silencers on inlet/outlet
- Flexible vibration dampeners for mounting
- Acoustic ducting

### Static Pressure

Important parameter when using filter or long ducts:

- **Low** (<5lt;50 Pa) — only for short systems without filter
- **Medium** (50-150 Pa) — standard for most grow boxes
- **High** (>1gt;150 Pa) — for complex systems with filters

### Power Consumption

Inline fans are very economical:

| Power | Diameter | Consumption |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 100 CFM | 4" | 15-25W |
| 200 CFM | 5" | 25-35W |
| 400 CFM | 6" | 40-60W |
| 740 CFM | 8" | 70-100W |

Running 24/7, a 4" fan consumes only **0.4-0.6 kWh/day** (~$2-3 per month).

## Speed Controllers

### Why Need Controller

- **Noise Reduction** — running at 60-70% is 2-3x quieter
- **Precise Climate Control** — temperature and humidity management
- **Energy Savings** — 30-50% consumption reduction
- **Extended Lifespan** — less bearing wear

### Controller Types

**Manual Voltage Regulators**
- Cheapest ($10-20)
- Turn dial — speed changes
- Downside: may hum at low speeds

**Stepped Switches**
- Fixed modes (40%, 60%, 80%, 100%)
- No humming
- Simple and reliable

**Automatic Thermostats**
- Temperature sensor controls speed
- Convenient: set and forget
- AC Infinity controllers — best on market

**Smart Controllers with Wi-Fi**
- Control via smartphone
- Charts, history, alerts
- AC Infinity CloudLine Pro/T-series

## Connection Diagram

### Basic Diagram

```
[Filter] ← [Fan] ← [Ducting] ← [Tent Exit]
```

Fan **pulls** air through filter (doesn't push).

### Extended Diagram

```
[Filter] → [Silencer] → [Fan] → [Silencer] → [Exit]
```

Two silencers maximize noise reduction.

## Installation and Mounting

### Where to Place

**Inside tent** (recommended):
- Saves outside space
- Easier installation
- Can use straps or hangers

**Outside tent**:
- Frees up inside space
- Easier to service
- May be louder (sound not dampened by walls)

### Mounting

- **Hanging straps** — best option (dampens vibration)
- **Metal clamps** — rigid, may transmit vibration
- **On floor** — acceptable for centrifugal fans

## Common Mistakes

**Buying too weak fan**
- Result: high temperature, poor air exchange
- Solution: always buy with 20-30% reserve

**Connecting fan wrong direction**
- Result: air goes backward
- Solution: check direction arrow on housing

**Rigid mounting without vibration isolation**
- Result: vibration transfers to frame, loud hum
- Solution: use straps or rubber hangers

## Growie Tip

Don't skimp on the fan — it's one of three key purchases (light, ventilation, nutrients). A good fan will last 5-10 years and pay for itself in harvest. We recommend AC Infinity CloudLine series — quiet, quality, with warranty. Connect fan to Growie via smart outlet for power consumption monitoring and automation.
