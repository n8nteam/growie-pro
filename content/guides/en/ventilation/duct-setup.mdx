# Ducting and Connections for Grow Box

![Ducting and connections](/images/guides/duct-setup.jpg)

Ducting is the link between fan, filter, and box exit. Proper ducting choice and installation reduce CFM loss, noise, and odor leak risk.

## Ducting Types

### Flexible Aluminum Ducting

**Most popular type for grow boxes**

**Construction**:
- Aluminum foil on wire frame
- Stretches and compresses (accordion)
- Easily bends in any direction

**Pros**:
- Cheap ($5-15 per 10 feet)
- Easy to install
- No tools needed for bends
- Compactly folds

**Cons**:
- Noisy (air "rustles" on ribs)
- High flow resistance
- May tear with strong stretching
- Collects dust and condensation in folds

**When to use**:
- Short distances (<6lt;6 feet)
- Inside tent (filter → fan)
- Budget setups

### Flexible Insulated Ducting

**Improved aluminum version**

**Construction**:
- Inner layer: smooth plastic
- Middle layer: insulation (mineral wool or foam)
- Outer layer: protective shell

**Pros**:
- Reduces noise (insulation dampens vibrations)
- Prevents condensation
- Less heat loss
- Smooth inner surface = less resistance

**Cons**:
- More expensive ($20-40 per 10 feet)
- Heavier and thicker
- Harder to bend (rigid insulation)

**When to use**:
- Long distances (>1gt;10 feet)
- Exit from box to another room
- Cold spaces (prevents condensation)
- Low noise level required

### Rigid Ducting (Metal/PVC)

**Professional option**

**Materials**:
- Galvanized steel
- Plastic (PVC)
- Stainless steel (expensive)

**Pros**:
- Minimum flow resistance (smooth surface)
- Very quiet
- Durable
- Easy to clean

**Cons**:
- Expensive ($30-80 per set)
- Require precise measurements and cutting
- Take up much space
- Need elbows, adapters, mounts

**When to use**:
- Permanent installations
- Long straight runs
- Professional rooms
- Maximum performance

### Acoustic Ducting

**Specialized noise-dampening**

**Construction**:
- Inside: sound-absorbing material
- Outside: rigid housing

**Pros**:
- Reduce noise by 30-50%
- Effective for high-frequency sounds

**Cons**:
- Very expensive ($80-150 per 3 feet)
- Heavy
- Reduce diameter (CFM decrease)

**When to use**:
- Only if noise critical (apartment, neighbors)
- Professional setups

## Ducting Diameters

### Standard Sizes

| Diameter | Application | Max CFM |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| 4" (100mm) | Small boxes (24"×24") | 200 CFM |
| 5" (125mm) | Rarely found | 300 CFM |
| 6" (150mm) | Medium boxes (32"×32", 39"×39") | 450 CFM |
| 8" (200mm) | Large boxes (47"×47"+) | 800 CFM |
| 10" (250mm) | Professional rooms | 1200 CFM |

### Selection Rule

**Ducting diameter = fan flange diameter**

❌ **Don't narrow ducting** after fan — this drastically reduces CFM and increases noise.

**Example**:
- Fan 6" (150mm)
- Ducting: 6" entire length
- If need transition to 4", use gradual adapter (reducer)

## Connectors and Fasteners

### Clamps

**Metal worm-drive clamps**:
- Most reliable
- Adjustable diameter
- Price: $1-3 each
- Tighten with screwdriver

**Quick-release clamps**:
- Spring-loaded, no tools
- Convenient for frequent disassembly
- Price: $3-5 each

**How to use**:
- Put ducting on flange 1-2 inches
- Tighten clamp 1 inch from edge
- Check for air leak (by hand)

### Metal Tape (Aluminum Foil Tape)

**For sealing joints**

**Pros**:
- Cheap ($5-10 per roll)
- Heat resistant
- Leaves no glue residue

**Cons**:
- Not long-lasting (1-2 years)
- May peel with vibration

**How to use**:
- Wrap ducting and flange joint
- Smooth out to avoid bubbles
- Replace at first peel signs

❌ **Don't use regular tape** — it softens from heat and loses adhesion.

### Adapters (Reducers)

**For connecting different diameters**

**Types**:
- 6" → 4" (reduction)
- 4" → 6" (increase, rarely needed)
- Stepped (6" → 5" → 4")

**Rule**:
- Use adapters only when absolutely necessary
- Smoother transition = less CFM loss

**CFM Loss**:
- Gradual adapter: -5-10%
- Abrupt transition: -20-30%

### Flanges

**Connectors for rigid ducting**

**Metal flanges**:
- With bolt holes
- Seal with gasket or silicone
- For permanent installations

**Plastic flanges**:
- Quick connection (clips)
- For temporary systems

## Silencers

### How They Work

**Principle**:
- Inside: sound-absorbing material (mineral wool, acoustic foam)
- Sound waves scatter and dampen

**Noise reduction**:
- One silencer: -10-15 dB
- Two silencers (before and after fan): -20-25 dB

### Silencer Types

**Inline (tube)**:
- Built into ducting
- Length 12-24 inches
- Price: $30-80

**Box**:
- Large volume, maximum noise dampening
- Size: 16"×16"×24"
- Price: $80-150

### Installing Silencers

**Scheme 1: One silencer before fan**
```
[Filter] → [Silencer] → [Fan] → [Ducting]
```
Reduces intake noise.

**Scheme 2: Silencer after fan**
```
[Filter] → [Fan] → [Silencer] → [Ducting]
```
Reduces exhaust noise.

**Scheme 3: Two silencers (maximum quiet)**
```
[Filter] → [Silencer 1] → [Fan] → [Silencer 2] → [Ducting]
```
Dampens noise from both sides.

**Important**: silencers reduce CFM by 10-20% (factor in when choosing fan).

## Minimizing CFM Loss

### Loss Factors

| Factor | CFM Loss |
|--------|----------|
| Each 3 feet ducting | -3-5% |
| 90° bend | -10-15% |
| 45° bend | -5-7% |
| Gradual adapter | -5-10% |
| Abrupt adapter | -20-30% |
| Carbon filter | -25-30% |
| Silencer | -10-20% |

### Installation Rules

**1. Shortest possible ducting**
- Each extra foot = CFM loss
- Optimal: filter → 20 inches → fan → 3-6 feet → exit

**2. Minimum bends**
- Straight line — ideal
- If bend unavoidable, make it gradual (radius &gt;6 inches)

**3. Avoid narrowing**
- Don't reduce diameter after fan
- If must narrow, use gradual reducer

**4. Fully stretch flexible ducting**
- Compressed ducting = high resistance
- Stretch to smooth state

**5. Secure ducting**
- Don't let it sag and bend
- Use hangers, ties, brackets

## Preventing Condensation

### Why Condensation Appears

- Warm humid air from box
- Cold ducting walls
- Moisture condenses → water drops

### Solutions

**Insulated ducting**:
- Best option for cold spaces

**Slope ducting**:
- Ducting should have slight downward slope
- Condensation drains back to box or collection container

**Drain holes**:
- Drill small hole at lowest point
- Place container to collect condensation

**Space heating**:
- If room temperature &gt;59°F, almost no condensation

## Ducting Exit from Box

### Exit Options

**To window**:
- Simplest option
- Use window adapter
- Seal gaps to not lose heat in winter

**To ventilation shaft**:
- Permanent solution
- Check shaft doesn't lead to neighbors
- May need check valve (so odor doesn't return)

**To next room**:
- Drill hole in wall
- Use decorative grille on other side

**To attic/basement**:
- For private houses
- Ensure moisture doesn't harm structures

## Common Mistakes

**Too long ducting**
- Result: CFM drop, overheating, weak air exchange
- Solution: maximum 10-13 feet, or use more powerful fan

**Sharp 90° bends**
- Result: turbulence, noise, CFM loss
- Solution: make gradual bends or use 45° elbows

**Unstretched flexible ducting**
- Result: ducting compressed "accordion", high resistance
- Solution: fully stretch ducting

**Unsecured ducting**
- Result: sagging, bends, vibration, noise
- Solution: secure every 3-5 feet

**Using regular tape**
- Result: tape peels from heat, air and odor leaks
- Solution: only aluminum foil tape

## Growie Tip

Don't skimp on ducting quality — cheap aluminum quickly tears and creates noise. For quiet system use insulated ducting and one-two silencers. Keep ducting as short and straight as possible to not lose CFM. If making permanent installation, consider rigid PVC ducting — quieter, more efficient, and lasts years. Track temperature in Growie app: if rising, ducting may be too long or have too many bends.
