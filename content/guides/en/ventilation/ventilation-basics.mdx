# Ventilation Basics for Grow Box

![Grow box ventilation system](/images/guides/ventilation-basics.jpg)

Ventilation is one of the three main grow box systems alongside lighting and watering. Without proper air exchange, plants suffer from overheating, CO2 deficiency, high humidity, and stagnant air.

## Why Ventilation is Needed

### Main Functions

**Fresh CO2 Supply**
- Plants absorb CO2 for photosynthesis
- In closed spaces, CO2 depletes quickly
- Air exchange replenishes carbon dioxide supply

**Temperature Control**
- Lights generate significant heat
- Ideal temperature: 72-82°F (veg), 68-79°F (flower)
- Without exhaust, temperature can exceed 95°F

**Humidity Regulation**
- Plants transpire large amounts of water
- High humidity (>7gt;70%) = mold and rot
- Fresh dry air intake reduces humidity

**Plant Strengthening**
- Air movement simulates wind
- Stems become thicker and stronger
- Improves nutrient transport

## System Operating Principle

Effective ventilation works on the principle of **negative pressure**:

```
Intake (passive) < Exhaust (active)
```

This means the exhaust fan should remove air *faster* than it enters through intake vents. As a result:
- Tent walls slightly pull inward
- Air enters the box only through controlled openings
- Odor doesn't leak outside
- All exhaust passes through filter

## Basic Components

### Minimum System

For beginner growers, only 3 components are needed:

1. **Inline Exhaust Fan**
   - Installed at top of tent
   - Removes hot air and odors
   - Power depends on box volume

2. **Intake Vents**
   - Usually at bottom of tent (built into tent)
   - Area 2-4x larger than exhaust
   - Can be partially closed for adjustment

3. **Circulation Fan**
   - Regular oscillating fan
   - Creates circulation inside box
   - Direct *NOT straight* at plants

### Advanced System

When budget allows, add:

- **Carbon Filter** — eliminates odors (essential during flowering)
- **Intake Fan** — active fresh air supply
- **Thermo/Hygro-controller** — automatic climate management
- **Silencers** — reduce ventilation noise

## Fan Power Calculation

Basic formula for calculating CFM (cubic feet per minute):

```
CFM = Tent Volume × Air Exchange Rate
```

**Tent Volume**:
- Size 32"×32"×71" = 2.7' × 2.7' × 5.9' = 43 cubic feet

**Air Exchange Rate**:
- Without filter: 60-80 times per hour (1-1.3 times per minute)
- With carbon filter: 80-100 times per hour (add 30% reserve)

**Example**:
- Tent 43 ft³ × 1.5 = **65 CFM** minimum
- With filter: 65 × 1.3 = **85 CFM**

## Typical Beginner Mistakes

### Too Weak Fan
**Symptoms**: high temperature (>8gt;86°F), heat stress, plants wilting
**Solution**: choose fan with 20-30% reserve

### No Circulation
**Symptoms**: thin weak stems, plants falling over, leaf mold
**Solution**: add 1-2 small fans inside

### Intake Larger Than Exhaust
**Symptoms**: tent walls bulge outward, odor leaking
**Solution**: partially open intake vents, reduce intake

### Fan Running 24/7 at Maximum
**Symptoms**: low humidity (<&lt;30%), plants drying out, noise
**Solution**: use speed controller or timer

## Connection Diagram

Standard exhaust sequence:

```
Filter → Fan → Ducting → Tent Exit
```

Or (quieter option):

```
Filter → Ducting → Fan → Exit
```

Fan *always* pulls air through filter, not pushes.

## Ventilation Schedule

| Growth Stage | Temperature | Humidity | Exhaust Mode |
|--------------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Seedling | 72-77°F | 65-70% | Continuous 40-60% |
| Vegetation | 72-82°F | 50-70% | Continuous 60-80% |
| Flowering | 68-79°F | 40-50% | Continuous 80-100% |

## Growie Tip

Start with a simple system: inline fan + circulation. Carbon filter can be added later, before flowering starts when odor appears. Use Growie app for temperature and humidity monitoring — you'll quickly understand which ventilation settings are optimal for your box.
