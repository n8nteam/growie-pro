# CO2 Enrichment for Faster Growth

![CO2 system in grow box](/images/guides/co2-enrichment.jpg)

CO2 enrichment is an advanced technique that boosts photosynthesis rate and can increase yield by 20-40%. But it only works under ideal conditions and requires precise control.

## Why CO2 Increases Yield

### CO2's Role in Photosynthesis

**Photosynthesis formula**:
```
6 CO2 + 6 H2O + light → C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6 O2
```

- Plants absorb CO2 from air through leaf stomata
- CO2 — main building material for biomass
- More CO2 = faster synthesis = greater growth

### CO2 Levels

| Conditions | CO2 Concentration | Effect |
|------------|------------------|--------|
| Atmospheric air | 420 ppm | Base growth rate |
| Closed box (no ventilation) | 200-300 ppm | Growth slowdown |
| Optimal enrichment | 1000-1500 ppm | Growth accelerated 20-40% |
| Toxic level | >2000 ppm | Dangerous to humans |

**Conclusion**: in closed box CO2 quickly depletes, plants slow down. Enrichment restores optimal level.

## When NOT to Use CO2

**❌ Beginners**:
- First master basic skills (watering, nutrients, light)
- CO2 only works under ideal conditions

**❌ With weak lighting**:
- Need minimum 600-800 PPFD (LED 350W+ per m²)
- Weak light = CO2 not absorbed

**❌ With poor nutrition**:
- Plants need more NPK for accelerated growth
- Without nutrients CO2 is useless

**❌ With poor climate**:
- Optimal temperature: 79-86°F (higher than usual!)
- Humidity: 50-60%
- VPD: 1.2-1.4 kPa

**✅ Use CO2 only if**:
- Experienced grower
- Powerful light (LED 40W+/sq ft or HPS)
- Stable climate
- Full nutrition control

## CO2 Enrichment Methods

### 1. CO2 Tanks with Regulator

**Most precise and controlled method**

**Equipment**:
- CO2 tank (10-45 lbs)
- Regulator with flow meter
- Solenoid valve (on/off)
- Timer or CO2 controller
- Price: $200-500

**Pros**:
- Precise control (PPM-meter)
- Constant supply
- No heat output
- One tank = 2-6 months

**Cons**:
- High initial cost
- Need tank refills
- Requires setup

**Consumption calculation**:
```
Flow (L/hour) = Box Volume (m³) × Target Increase (ppm) / 1000
```

**Example for 2 m³ box (39"×39"×79")**:
- Increase: 1000 ppm (from 400 to 1400)
- Flow: 2 × 1000 / 1000 = **2 liters CO2 per hour**
- 20 lb tank (10,000 liters) lasts: 10,000 / 2 / 12 (light hours) = **420 days**

### 2. CO2 Generators (Propane/Natural Gas)

**For large installations**

**How it works**:
- Propane combustion: C3H8 + 5 O2 → 3 CO2 + 4 H2O
- Produces CO2, heat and moisture

**Pros**:
- Cheaper than tanks (for large volumes)
- Autonomous (20 lb propane tank)

**Cons**:
- **Generates lots of heat** (+9-18°F in box)
- **Raises humidity** (water evaporation)
- Fire risk (open flame)
- Not suitable for small boxes

**When to use**:
- Rooms from 100+ sq ft
- Winter (heat is advantage)
- Professional setups

### 3. CO2 Bags/Pouches (Mushrooms)

**Simple method for beginners**

**How it works**:
- Mushroom mycelium consumes substrate and releases CO2
- Bag hangs in tent, slowly releases CO2

**Pros**:
- Cheap ($20-30 per bag)
- No setup or equipment
- Safe

**Cons**:
- **Can't control** CO2 level
- Weak output (only for small boxes)
- Lifespan: 3-6 months
- Raises humidity

**Effectiveness**:
- For 24"×24" box: noticeable effect
- For 39"×39" box: weak effect
- For 47"×47"+ boxes: almost useless

**Popular brands**:
- ExHale CO2 Bags
- TNB Naturals CO2 Refill Pack

### 4. Yeast + Sugar (DIY Method)

**Homemade option**

**Ingredients**:
- Water 2 liters
- Sugar 500g
- Yeast 10g

**Principle**:
- Yeast ferments sugar: C6H12O6 → 2 CO2 + 2 C2H5OH
- CO2 enters box through tube

**Pros**:
- Very cheap (~$2 per mix)

**Cons**:
- Unstable CO2 supply
- Need to change every 5-10 days
- Produces alcohol (smell)
- Hard to control
- Not recommended (too much hassle)

### 5. Dry Ice

**Exotic method**

**Principle**:
- Dry ice = solid CO2
- When evaporating releases pure CO2

**Pros**:
- Pure CO2 (100%)
- Cools air (good in summer)

**Cons**:
- Expensive ($3-5 per kg)
- Evaporates quickly (1 kg in 12-24 hours)
- Need to buy frequently
- Hard to control

**Conclusion**: not recommended (uneconomical).

## CO2 System Setup

### CO2 Supply Schedule

**When to supply**:
- ✅ Only with lights on (plants photosynthesize)
- ❌ At night CO2 is useless (photosynthesis stops)

**Operating mode**:
- First 15 minutes after lights on: **intensive supply**
- Next 11.5 hours: **level maintenance** (supply on timer: 5 min on / 30 min off)
- Last 30 minutes before lights off: **stop supply**

### Integration with Ventilation

**Problem**: exhaust removes CO2 from box

**Solution 1: Sync with Ventilation**
```
1. Ventilation turns off
2. CO2 supplied (5-10 minutes)
3. CO2 turns off
4. Ventilation turns on (20-30 minutes)
5. Repeat cycle
```

**Solution 2: Reduce Exhaust**
- Exhaust runs at 30-50% power (minimum air exchange)
- CO2 supplied constantly
- Requires more CO2 (more expensive)

**Solution 3: Sealed Box with Recirculation**
- Minimum exhaust (only for temperature reduction)
- CO2 supplied constantly
- Use air conditioner or cooling
- For professionals

### CO2 Level Monitoring

**CO2 meters (PPM-meters)**:
- **Basic** ($60-100): show current PPM
- **Advanced** ($150-300): controllers with automatic supply
- **Professional** ($300-800): integration with climate controllers

**Popular models**:
- TrolMaster Hydro-X CO2 Sensor ($150)
- Autopilot Desktop CO2 Monitor ($120)
- CO2Meter AZ-0004 ($100)

### Target CO2 Level

| Growth Stage | Target PPM |
|--------------|------------|
| Seedling | 400-600 ppm (no enrichment needed) |
| Vegetation | 1000-1200 ppm |
| Flowering | 1200-1500 ppm |
| Last 2 weeks | 400 ppm (stop enrichment) |

**Important**: don't exceed 1500 ppm — above this effect doesn't grow, but costs increase.

## CO2 Safety

### Danger to Humans

| CO2 Level | Effect on Humans |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 400 ppm | Normal (atmospheric air) |
| 1000 ppm | Safe |
| 2000 ppm | Drowsiness, poor concentration |
| 5000 ppm | Headache, rapid breathing |
| 10000+ ppm | Life-threatening (suffocation) |

**Safety rules**:
- ❌ Don't stay in box with CO2 on longer than 10-15 minutes
- ✅ Ventilate room before entering
- ✅ Install CO2 detector with alert
- ❌ Don't sleep in room with running CO2 generator

### CO2 Leak Risk

- Tanks under pressure (~50-60 bar)
- Regulator must have safety valve
- Check leaks with soapy water (bubbles = leak)
- Store tanks vertically, secured

## Adjusting Conditions for CO2

### Temperature

**Without CO2**: 72-79°F
**With CO2**: 79-86°F (plants absorb CO2 more actively at elevated temperature)

**How to raise temperature**:
- Reduce exhaust
- Use more powerful lights
- Heater in room

### Nutrition

**Plants need more NPK with CO2**:
- Increase nutrient concentration by 20-30%
- Monitor EC: avoid overfeeding
- Use Cal-Mag additionally (accelerated growth requires more calcium)

### Lighting

**Minimum for CO2 effectiveness**:
- LED: 600-1000 PPFD (40W+ per sq ft)
- HPS: 600W-1000W per m²

**If less light**: CO2 not fully absorbed, waste of money.

## Profitability Calculation

### Example for 39"×39" box (1 m²)

**Without CO2**:
- Yield: 14 oz/m²
- Costs: $300 (light, nutrients, substrate)
- Profit: $400 yield - $300 = **$100**

**With CO2**:
- Yield: 17.5 oz/m² (+25%)
- Costs: $300 + $150 (CO2 system + tank) = $450
- Profit: $500 - $450 = **$50** (first grow)

**From second grow**:
- Yield: 17.5 oz/m²
- Costs: $300 + $30 (tank refill) = $330
- Profit: $500 - $330 = **$170** (+70% vs regular grow)

**Conclusion**: CO2 pays off from second-third grow.

## Common Mistakes

**Supplying CO2 at night**
- Plants don't photosynthesize, CO2 wasted
- Solution: timer on solenoid valve (only during lights)

**High exhaust + CO2**
- Exhaust removes CO2 faster than absorbed
- Solution: sync ventilation and CO2 (cyclic operation)

**CO2 with weak light**
- Plants can't absorb additional CO2
- Solution: minimum 600 PPFD, otherwise don't use CO2

**No PPM monitoring**
- Supply too weak (no effect) or too strong (money waste)
- Solution: buy CO2 meter

**Using CO2 on seedlings**
- Seedlings weakly absorb CO2, no enrichment needed
- Solution: start CO2 from week 3-4 of veg

## Alternatives to CO2 Enrichment

**If CO2 too complex or expensive**:

1. **Improve ventilation**:
   - Fresh air constantly replenishes CO2 (420 ppm)
   - Not as effective as enrichment, but free

2. **Increase plant quantity**:
   - More plants = bigger yield (without CO2)

3. **Optimize light and nutrition**:
   - Powerful light + proper nutrients give +15-20% without CO2

## Growie Tip

CO2 enrichment — for experienced growers who've already mastered all basic techniques. If you're still struggling with pH, overfeeding or overheating, skip CO2 and focus on basics. When climate is stable, light powerful and nutrition precise — then add CO2 for final yield boost of 20-40%. Use Growie app for PPM monitoring and ventilation system integration — so you don't waste CO2.
