# Carbon Filters for Grow Box

![Carbon filter in ventilation system](/images/guides/carbon-filters.jpg)

A carbon filter is the only effective way to completely eliminate odor from a grow box. During flowering, the smell becomes very strong, and without a filter, neighbors, guests, and even passersby will notice it.

## How It Works

### Activated Carbon

Filters use **activated carbon** — a porous material with enormous surface area:
- 1 gram of carbon = 500-1500 m² surface area
- Pores capture odor molecules (terpenes)
- Air passes through cleaned

### Filter Construction

```
[Outer Screen] → [Carbon Layer 4-6cm] → [Inner Cylinder] → [Exit]
```

Air passes through outer pre-filtering screen, then through carbon layer where odor molecules are adsorbed, and exits cleaned through central opening.

### Lifespan

- **Standard conditions**: 12-18 months
- **High humidity (>70%)**: 6-12 months (carbon saturates faster)
- **Low air speed**: up to 24 months
- **Wear signs**: faint odor starts leaking through

## How to Choose Filter

### CFM Match with Fan

**Main rule**: Filter CFM ≥ Fan CFM

| Tent Size | Fan | Filter |
|-----------|-----|--------|
| 24"×24" | 100-150 CFM | 150+ CFM |
| 32"×32" | 150-200 CFM | 200+ CFM |
| 39"×39" | 200-350 CFM | 350+ CFM |
| 47"×47" | 350-450 CFM | 450+ CFM |

If filter CFM is lower than fan:
- Filter wears out faster
- Reduced effectiveness
- Odor may leak

### Size and Weight

Filters come in different sizes for same CFM:

**Example for 400 CFM**:
- **Short and thick**: 12" length × 8" diameter, 18 lbs
- **Long and thin**: 20" length × 6" diameter, 22 lbs

**How to choose**:
- Short filter — if limited height space
- Long filter — lasts longer (more carbon)

### Flange Diameter

Flange (exit opening) must match fan diameter:

- 4" (100mm) — for small boxes
- 5" (125mm) — rarely found
- 6" (150mm) — most popular
- 8" (200mm) — for large systems

If sizes don't match, use adapter (reducer).

## Filter Installation

### Inside Tent (recommended)

**Connection diagram**:
```
[Filter inside] → [Fan inside/outside] → [Ducting] → [Exit]
```

**Pros**:
- Maximum efficiency (carbon filters all box air)
- Easy to replace pre-filter
- No need for long ducting

**Cons**:
- Takes up tent space (~8-12" height)
- Need strong hanging (filter is heavy)

### Outside Tent

**Diagram**:
```
[Ducting from tent] → [Filter outside] → [Fan] → [Exit]
```

**Pros**:
- Frees up inside space
- Easier to service

**Cons**:
- Unfiltered air goes through ducting (leak risk)
- Need long ducting

### Mounting

**Straps and hangers** (best option):
- Use adjustable ratchet hangers
- Attach to top tent frame
- Leave strength reserve (filter weighs 10-35 lbs)

**Clamps and brackets**:
- For wall mounting outside
- Require drilling walls

## Filter Maintenance

### Pre-filter

**What is it**: fabric sleeve on outer surface, protects carbon from dust

**Care**:
- Vacuum or shake off dust every 2-4 weeks
- Wash every 1-2 months (hand wash, no bleach)
- Fully dry before installing
- Replace if torn or heavily soiled

### When to Replace Filter

**Wear signs**:
- Odor starts leaking outside
- 12-18 months of operation passed
- Filter got wet or repeatedly wet

**Cannot restore**:
- ❌ Washing with water (carbon loses properties)
- ❌ Baking in oven (destroys structure)
- ❌ Compressed air blowing (ineffective)

**Only option** — buy new or replace carbon (complicated and not always cost-effective).

## Recommended Models

**Phresh Filter** (Australia)
- **CFM**: 200-1000 CFM
- **Lifespan**: 2+ years
- **Price**: $80-250
- **Pros**: longest lifespan, quality carbon
- **Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Can-Filter** (Canada)
- **CFM**: 150-1500 CFM

- **Pros**: proven brand, reliability
- **Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

### Mid-Range Filters

**iPower Carbon Filter**
- **CFM**: 200-1000 CFM
- **Lifespan**: 12-18 months
- **Price**: $40-100
- **Pros**: affordable price, good quality
- **Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Vivosun Carbon Filter**
- **CFM**: 190-950 CFM
- **Lifespan**: 12-18 months
- **Price**: $35-95
- **Pros**: budget-friendly, popular
- **Cons**: heavy, short lifespan
- **Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

### Budget Filters

**Apollo Horticulture / Hydro Crunch**
- **CFM**: 200-700 CFM
- **Lifespan**: 9-12 months
- **Price**: $30-70
- **Pros**: cheap
- **Cons**: odor may leak in final months
- **Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐

## Alternatives to Carbon Filter

### ONA Gel / ONA Block

**Principle**: neutralizes odors in air (doesn't filter)

**Pros**:
- Cheap ($15-25 per jar)
- No installation

**Cons**:
- May affect harvest taste (if inside tent)
- Masks odor, doesn't fully eliminate
- Consumption: 1 jar = 4-8 weeks

**Where to use**: only outside tent, in room with box

### Ozone Generators

**Principle**: ozone destroys odor molecules

**Pros**:
- Very effective
- No filter replacement needed

**Cons**:
- **Dangerous to health** (ozone is toxic)
- Cannot use in living spaces
- May damage plants
- Expensive ($150-500)

**Conclusion**: use only in industrial setups with separate ventilation.

## Common Mistakes

**Installing filter with fan pushing**
- ❌ Wrong: [Fan] → [Filter]
- ✅ Right: [Filter] → [Fan]

**Ignoring pre-filter**
- Result: carbon quickly clogs with dust, lifespan halved

**Using filter in humid environment**
- Result: carbon saturates with moisture, loses effectiveness

**Too powerful fan**
- If fan CFM >> filter CFM, air passes too quickly and odor doesn't filter properly

## Cost of Ownership

### Example for 39"×39" box

**Option 1: Budget filter**
- Price: $40
- Lifespan: 12 months
- Cost per year: $40

**Option 2: Premium filter**
- Price: $120
- Lifespan: 24 months
- Cost per year: $60

**Conclusion**: premium filters are more cost-effective long-term despite higher initial price.

## Growie Tip

Don't skimp on the filter — odor during flowering can cause problems with neighbors and attract unwanted attention. Buy filter with CFM reserve (+20-30%), this extends lifespan and guarantees complete odor elimination. Set filter replacement timers in Growie app so you don't forget to update it on time.
