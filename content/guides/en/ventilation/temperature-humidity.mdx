# Temperature and Humidity Control Through Ventilation

![Climate controller in grow box](/images/guides/temperature-humidity.jpg)

Ventilation is the main tool for managing temperature and humidity in a grow box. Proper setup creates optimal microclimate at each growth stage.

## Target Climate Parameters

### Temperature

| Stage | Day (lights on) | Night (lights off) |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| Seedling/clones | 72-77°F | 64-72°F |
| Vegetation | 72-82°F | 64-75°F |
| Flowering | 68-79°F | 64-72°F |
| Last 2 weeks | 64-75°F | 59-68°F |

**Important**:
- Day/night difference: 7-14°F (stimulates metabolism)
- Above 86°F: heat stress, growth slowdown
- Below 59°F: growth stops, mold risk

### Humidity (RH)

| Stage | Optimal Humidity |
|-------|------------------|
| Seedling/clones | 65-75% |
| Vegetation | 50-70% |
| Early flowering | 45-55% |
| Late flowering | 40-50% |
| Last 2 weeks | 35-45% |

**Important**:
- High humidity (>70%) → mold, rot
- Low humidity (<30%) → drying out, stress

## VPD — Main Microclimate Indicator

### What is VPD

**VPD (Vapour Pressure Deficit)** — vapor pressure deficit. Shows how effectively plant can transpire moisture.

**Formula** (simplified):
```
VPD = (100 - RH) / 100 × SVP(temperature)
```

### Target VPD Values

| Stage | VPD (kPa) |
|-------|-----------|
| Clones/seedlings | 0.4-0.8 |
| Vegetation | 0.8-1.2 |
| Flowering | 1.0-1.5 |

**What it means**:
- **Low VPD** (<0.4): plants transpire poorly, mold risk
- **Optimal VPD** (0.8-1.5): active growth, good metabolism
- **High VPD** (>1.5): drought stress, plants close stomata

### How to Regulate VPD

**If VPD too low** (too humid):
- Increase exhaust (remove humid air)
- Reduce watering
- Add circulation fans

**If VPD too high** (too dry):
- Decrease exhaust (keep moisture inside)
- Add humidifier
- Increase evaporation area (more plants, water trays)

## Ventilation's Role in Climate Control

### How Ventilation Affects Temperature

**Exhaust removes hot air**:
- Lights heat air
- Hot air rises
- Exhaust removes it from box

**Intake supplies fresh air**:
- Intake temperature = room temperature
- If room is 72°F, intake air will be 72°F

**Rule**:
```
Box Temperature = Room Temperature + Heat from Lights
```

**Example**:
- Room temperature: 72°F
- 240W LED heats by +7-11°F
- Without exhaust: 72 + 11 = **83°F** (normal)
- Weak exhaust: 72 + 18 = **90°F** (overheating)

### How Ventilation Affects Humidity

**Plants transpire water**:
- Through leaf stomata (transpiration)
- In closed box humidity quickly rises

**Exhaust removes humid air**:
- Stronger exhaust = lower humidity
- Dry air intake "dilutes" moisture

**Rule**:
```
Box Humidity = Room Humidity + Plant Transpiration
```

**Example**:
- Room humidity: 50%
- 4 plants in veg transpire lots of water
- Without exhaust: 50% → 75-85% per hour
- With exhaust: stable 55-60%

## Climate Automation

### Thermo-Hygrostats

**What is it**: device that turns fan on/off based on temperature and humidity

**Types**:
- **Simple** ($20-40): one sensor, one relay
- **Advanced** ($60-120): two sensors (temp + humidity), LCD display
- **Smart-controllers** ($150-300): Wi-Fi, app, charts, alerts

### Setting Up Thermo-Hygrostat

**Example setup for veg**:

```
Temperature:
  - Turn fan on 100% if >81°F
  - Turn on 60% if >77°F
  - Turn off if <75°F

Humidity:
  - Turn on 80% if >65%
  - Turn on 50% if >55%
  - Turn off if <50%
```

**Hysteresis** (turn-off delay):
- Set 2-4°F or 5-10% RH
- Prevents frequent on/off (extends fan life)

## Solving Temperature Problems

### Problem: Overheating (>86°F)

**Causes**:
- Weak exhaust
- Powerful lights (HPS, poor LEDs)
- Hot room
- Poor intake

**Solutions**:

1. **Increase exhaust**:
   - Set fan to 100%
   - Use more powerful fan (+30% CFM)

2. **Improve intake**:
   - Fully open intake vents
   - Add active intake fan
   - Take air from coolest room

3. **Cool room**:
   - Use air conditioner in room with box
   - Turn lights on at night (when cooler)

4. **Change lighting**:
   - Replace HPS with LED (less heat)
   - Use dimmer to reduce power

5. **Active cooling**:
   - Portable air conditioner (supply cold air to box)
   - Ducting cooling (ice water in tank, air passes through radiator)

### Problem: Too Cold (<64°F)

**Causes**:
- Cold room
- Too strong exhaust
- Winter, no heating

**Solutions**:

1. **Reduce exhaust**:
   - Set fan to 40-60%
   - Use thermostat (fan only turns on when overheating)

2. **Close intake partially**:
   - Close some intake vents
   - Use deflector to redirect cold air

3. **Heat room**:
   - Use heater in room (not in tent!)
   - Turn lights on during day (when warmer)

4. **Use HPS lights**:
   - They generate more heat (can be advantage)

5. **Insulate box**:
   - Use thermal insulation materials outside

## Solving Humidity Problems

### Problem: High Humidity (>70%)

**Causes**:
- Weak exhaust
- Many plants (heavy transpiration)
- Humid room
- Overwatering

**Solutions**:

1. **Increase exhaust**:
   - Set to 80-100%
   - Install thermo-hygrostat (automatic control)

2. **Improve circulation**:
   - Add 1-2 circulation fans
   - Direct airflow between plants

3. **Dehumidifier**:
   - Place in room with box (not inside tent)
   - Capacity: 10-20 liters/day for 160-215 sq ft room

4. **Reduce watering**:
   - Water less and less often
   - Remove water trays

5. **Thin plantings**:
   - Fewer plants = less transpiration
   - Increase distance between pots

### Problem: Low Humidity (<40%)

**Causes**:
- Too strong exhaust
- Dry room (winter, heating)
- Small plants (little transpiration)

**Solutions**:

1. **Reduce exhaust**:
   - Set to 40-60%
   - Use hygrostat (turns on only at high humidity)

2. **Humidifier**:
   - Place in box or room
   - Ultrasonic or evaporative
   - Capacity: 1-3 liters/day

3. **Water trays**:
   - Place several shallow containers with water
   - Evaporation raises humidity 5-10%

4. **Increase leaf area**:
   - More plants
   - Don't trim leaves unnecessarily

5. **Wet towels**:
   - Hang damp towels inside box
   - Temporary solution for emergencies

## Ventilation Schedule by Stage

### Seedling (0-2 weeks)

**Goal**: 72-77°F, 65-75% RH, VPD 0.4-0.8

**Ventilation setup**:
- Exhaust: 30-50% power
- Circulation: weak, not aimed at seedlings
- Intake: partially closed (preserve humidity)

### Vegetation (2-6 weeks)

**Goal**: 72-82°F, 50-70% RH, VPD 0.8-1.2

**Ventilation setup**:
- Exhaust: 60-80% power
- Circulation: medium, aimed between plants
- Intake: open 70-80%

### Early Flowering (1-4 weeks)

**Goal**: 68-79°F, 45-55% RH, VPD 1.0-1.4

**Ventilation setup**:
- Exhaust: 70-90% power (remove moisture)
- Circulation: strong (improve circulation between buds)
- Intake: fully open
- Filter: essential (odor intensifies)

### Late Flowering (4-8 weeks)

**Goal**: 68-75°F, 40-50% RH, VPD 1.2-1.5

**Ventilation setup**:
- Exhaust: 80-100% power (maximum dryness)
- Circulation: strong (mold prevention)
- Intake: maximum
- Dehumidifier: if humidity >50%

### Last 2 Weeks (flush)

**Goal**: 64-75°F, 35-45% RH, VPD 1.4-1.6

**Ventilation setup**:
- Exhaust: 100% power
- Circulation: maximum (mold prevention on dense buds)
- Dehumidifier: recommended

## Growie Integration

**Growie** helps track climate and optimize settings:

- **Monitoring**: temperature and humidity charts 24/7
- **Alerts**: notifications when out of range
- **VPD calculator**: automatic optimal VPD calculation
- **Recommendations**: how to adjust ventilation

## Growie Tip

Don't chase perfect numbers — plants forgive small deviations (±4°F, ±10% RH). Main thing — stability and no sudden spikes. Use thermo-hygrostat for climate automation, this saves time and reduces plant stress. Track VPD in Growie app — it's better microclimate indicator than just temperature or humidity separately.
