# Air Intake in Grow Box: Passive vs Active

![Air intake diagram in grow box](/images/guides/intake-passive-active.jpg)

Exhaust removes old air, but where does fresh air come from? Proper intake organization is critical for stable climate, air exchange, and odor control.

## Negative Pressure Principle

### Why It Matters

**Negative pressure** = pressure inside box is lower than outside

**Result**:
- Tent walls slightly pull inward
- Air enters only through controlled openings
- Odor **doesn't leak** through zippers and seams
- All exhaust passes through filter

### How to Create Negative Pressure

```
Intake (CFM) < Exhaust (CFM)
```

**Optimal ratio**:
- Exhaust: 100%
- Intake: 60-80% of exhaust

**Example**:
- Exhaust fan: 200 CFM
- Intake openings: equivalent of 120-160 CFM

## Passive Intake

### What Is It

Air enters naturally through tent openings — **without intake fan**.

**How it works**:
- Exhaust fan creates negative pressure
- Air is sucked through intake vents
- Larger openings = stronger intake

### Passive Intake Pros

✅ **Simplicity**: no additional fan needed
✅ **Silent**: no extra noise sources
✅ **Economy**: no electricity required
✅ **Negative pressure**: automatically created

### Passive Intake Cons

❌ **Depends on external temperature**: hot air in summer, cold in winter
❌ **No filtration**: dust and spores enter
❌ **Limited control**: difficult to precisely regulate

### Calculating Intake Opening Area

**Rule**: intake area should be **2-4 times larger** than exhaust area.

**Formula**:
```
Intake Area = Exhaust Area × 3
```

**Example**:
- Exhaust: 6" (150mm) = 6" diameter
- Area: π × (3")² = 28 sq inches
- Intake openings: 28 × 3 = **84 sq inches**

This equals:
- Two 5" diameter openings each
- Or one 8"×11" screen

### Where to Place Intake Openings

**At bottom of tent** (recommended):
- Cold air is heavier and sinks down
- Hot air rises to exhaust
- Natural convection improves circulation

**Opposite exhaust**:
- Creates airflow through entire box
- Even fresh air distribution

**On opposite side**:
- If exhaust is top left, intake bottom right
- Air passes through entire tent, washing plants

## Active Intake

### What Is It

Intake using **additional fan** that pushes air inside.

### When to Use Active Intake

**Large boxes** (from 6'×6'):
- Passive intake insufficient
- Need even airflow

**Long ducting** (from external source):
- Air taken from neighboring room or outside
- Passive air won't pull through long duct

**Temperature control**:
- Can cool or heat intake air
- Take air from air-conditioned space

**Intake filtration**:
- HEPA filter on intake fan
- Protection from dust, spores, and insects

### Active Intake Pros

✅ **Precise control**: can regulate intake speed
✅ **Stability**: doesn't depend on box negative pressure
✅ **Filtration**: can install filter on intake
✅ **Long ducting**: take air from far away

### Active Intake Cons

❌ **Complexity**: need to balance two systems
❌ **Noise**: additional fan
❌ **Costs**: purchase and electricity
❌ **Positive pressure risk**: if intake > exhaust

### How to Set Up Active Intake

**Rule**: intake fan must be **weaker** than exhaust

**Optimal ratio**:
```
Intake = 60-80% of exhaust
```

**Example**:
- Exhaust: 400 CFM at 100%
- Intake: 200-300 CFM (or 400 CFM fan at 50-70% power)

**How to check balance**:
- Tent walls slightly pulled inward ✅
- Walls bulge outward ❌ (intake too strong)
- Walls heavily pulled inward ❌ (intake too weak)

## Hybrid System

### Passive Intake + Circulation

**Most popular scheme for small/medium boxes**:

```
[Intake vents at bottom] → [Tent] → [Circulation fan] → [Exhaust + filter]
```

- Passive intake provides air exchange
- Circulation fans create movement inside
- Exhaust removes stale air

**Pros**:
- Simple, cheap, effective
- Minimum noise
- Easy to set up

## Intake Air Filtration

### Why Filter Intake

- **Dust and dirt**: clog leaf stomata
- **Mold spores**: can infect plants
- **Insects**: thrips, spider mites, aphids
- **Pollen**: if male plants nearby

### Filter Types

**Mechanical pre-filters** (simplest):
- Fine mesh or fabric on intake opening
- Catches large particles (dust, insects)
- Cheap, easy to clean

**HEPA filters** (advanced):
- Catch 99.97% of particles >0.3 microns
- Complete protection from spores and dust
- Require active intake (won't pull passively)

**Carbon filters on intake** (rare):
- If taking air from smoky or polluted space
- Expensive and not always necessary

## Adjusting Intake Openings

### Built-in Dampers

Most grow tents have adjustable intake vents:
- **Fully open**: maximum intake (summer, high temperature)
- **Half open**: balanced mode
- **Partially closed**: minimum intake (winter, cold air)

### How to Adjust

**Step 1**: Fully open intake vents
**Step 2**: Turn on exhaust at working power
**Step 3**: Check tent walls — they should pull **slightly** inward
**Step 4**: If pulling too strongly — open intake more
**Step 5**: If not pulling — close intake partially

## Intake by Season

### Summer (hot)

**Problem**: intake air is hot (>86°F)

**Solutions**:
- Take air from coolest room
- Use air conditioner in room with box
- Increase exhaust to 100% power
- Add extra circulation fan

### Winter (cold)

**Problem**: intake air is cold (<59°F)

**Solutions**:
- Partially close intake vents (reduce intake)
- Lower exhaust from maximum (60-70% sufficient)
- Take air from warm room
- Use heater in room (not in tent!)

### Mid-season (optimal)

**Temperature 64-75°F** — ideal conditions:
- Intake open 70-80%
- Exhaust runs stable
- Minimum adjustments

## Common Mistakes

**Intake stronger than exhaust**
- Result: positive pressure, odor leaking outside
- Solution: reduce intake fan or close vents partially

**No intake at all**
- Result: tent walls heavily pulled in, fan overloaded, low CO2
- Solution: open intake vents

**Intake vents at top**
- Result: poor circulation, hot air immediately exits to exhaust
- Solution: use bottom openings

**Cold air directly on plants**
- Result: temperature stress, slow growth
- Solution: direct intake to side or use deflector

## Intake Organization Schemes

### Scheme 1: Basic (passive intake)

```
[Intake opening at bottom] → [Circulation] → [Plants] → [Exhaust + filter at top]
```

**For boxes**: 24"×24", 32"×32", 39"×39"
**Budget**: $0 (built into tent)

### Scheme 2: Active intake with filter

```
[Fan + HEPA] → [Ducting] → [Tent] → [Circulation] → [Exhaust + filter]
```

**For boxes**: 47"×47", 59"×59", large rooms
**Budget**: +$50-100 (fan + filter)

### Scheme 3: Air from outside/another room

```
[Outside air] → [Ducting 10-15ft] → [Intake fan] → [Tent] → [Exhaust]
```

**For boxes**: any, if room too hot/cold
**Budget**: +$60-120 (long ducting + fan)

## Growie Tip

For most growers, passive intake is the optimal choice. It's simple, silent, and effective. Use active intake only if you have large box (from 6'×6'), long ducting, or need intake filtration. Set up balance so tent walls slightly pull inward — this guarantees negative pressure and no odor outside. Track temperature and humidity in Growie to understand if intake mode needs adjustment.
