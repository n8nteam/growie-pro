# Startup Budgets: How Much to Start Growing

![Growing budget](/images/guides/grow-budget.jpg)

One of the first questions for beginners: how much money is needed to start? Let's break down three options with real numbers and ROI calculations.

## Budget 1: Minimal Starter — $250

### Equipment

| Item | Price |
|------|-------|
| Grow tent 2×2'×5' | $80 |
| LED panel 100W (budget) | $50 |
| Inline fan 4" (no filter) | $35 |
| Clip-on circulation fan | $15 |
| Fabric pots 2gal (3 pcs) | $12 |
| Soil BioBizz Light Mix 5gal | $20 |
| Nutrients BioBizz Grow + Bloom | $30 |
| pH meter | $18 |
| Thermo-hygrometer | $10 |
| Auto seeds (2 pcs) | $40 |
| **Total** | **$310** |

### Monthly Costs

- Electricity (LED 100W × 20h × 30 days = 60 kWh): **$10**
- **Total**: $10/month

### Expected Yield

- **2 autos**: 40-80g each
- **Total**: 80-160g in 10 weeks

### Cost Per Gram

```
Costs: $310 (equipment) + $25 (electricity 2.5 months)
Yield: 120g (average)
Cost: $335 / 120g = $2.80 per gram
```

**From second grow** (no equipment purchase):
```
$65 (electricity + new seeds) / 120g = $0.54 per gram
```

### Pros
✅ Minimal investment
✅ Fast ROI
✅ Can start immediately

### Cons
❌ Small yield
❌ No smell control
❌ Budget light quality

## Budget 2: Optimal — $550

### Equipment

| Item | Price |
|------|-------|
| Grow tent 3×3'×6' | $150 |
| LED panel 240W (Samsung LM301B) | $180 |
| Inline fan 6" + controller | $90 |
| Carbon filter 6" | $70 |
| Circulation fans (2 pcs) | $30 |
| Fabric pots 3gal (4 pcs) | $18 |
| Soil BioBizz All-Mix 13gal | $35 |
| Nutrients (full line + CalMag) | $60 |
| pH meter + EC meter | $50 |
| Thermo-hygrometer | $12 |

- **Total**: $20/month

### Expected Yield

- **3 photoperiods**: 80-150g each
- **Total**: 240-450g in 14 weeks

### Cost Per Gram

```
Costs: $780 (equipment) + $70 (electricity 3.5 months)
Yield: 350g (average)
Cost: $850 / 350g = $2.43 per gram
```

**From second grow**:
```
$130 (electricity + seeds) / 350g = $0.37 per gram
```

### Pros
✅ Good yield
✅ Smell control
✅ Quality light
✅ Room for experiments

### Cons

### Monthly Costs

- Electricity (LED 480W × 18h × 30 days = 260 kWh): **$40**
- CO2 refill (once per 6 months): **$30**
- **Total**: $45/month

### Expected Yield

- **4-6 photoperiods with CO2**: 150-250g each
- **Total**: 600-1000g in 14 weeks

### Cost Per Gram

```
Costs: $2155 (equipment) + $160 (supplies 3.5 months)
Yield: 800g (average)
Cost: $2315 / 800g = $2.89 per gram
```

**From second grow**:
```
$220 (supplies) / 800g = $0.28 per gram
```

## Comparison Table

| Parameter | Minimal | Optimal | Advanced |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Startup costs** | $310 | $780 | $2155 |
| **Monthly costs** | $10 | $20 | $45 |
| **Yield (g)** | 80-160 | 240-450 | 600-1000 |
| **Cost/g (1st grow)** | $2.80 | $2.43 | $2.89 |
| **Cost/g (2+ grows)** | $0.54 | $0.37 | $0.28 |
| **ROI** | 1 grow | 1-2 grows | 2-3 grows |
| **Plants** | 1-2 | 3-4 | 4-6 |
| **Difficulty** | Low | Medium | High |

## Hidden Costs

Don't forget additional expenses:

### At Start
- **Shipping**: $20-50
- **Tools** (screwdriver, zip ties, tape): $15-30
- **Beginner mistakes** (burned plants, replacement seeds): $30-100

### During Growth
- **Carbon filter replacement** (every 12-18 months): $60-100
- **pH calibration solution**: $10 every 3 months
- **Pest control** (if needed): $20-50
- **Extra nutrients**: $20-40

### At Harvest
- **Trim scissors**: $30
- **Drying rack**: $20
- **Curing jars**: $15

## ROI vs Store Prices

Assuming store price is **$10** per gram.

### Minimal Budget ($310)
- Yield: 120g = $1200 value
- **Paid off in 1 grow** with $890 profit

### Optimal Budget ($780)
- Yield: 350g = $3500 value
- **Paid off in 1 grow** with $2720 profit

### Advanced Budget ($2155)
- Yield: 800g = $8000 value
- **Paid off in 1 grow** with $5845 profit

**Conclusion**: any budget pays off from first harvest when compared to store prices.

## Savings When Shopping

### AliExpress vs Local Stores
- LED 240W: $180 (Ali) vs $300 (local) → save $120
- Tent 3×3': $150 (Ali) vs $220 (local) → save $70
- Fan 6": $90 (Ali) vs $150 (local) → save $60

**Total savings**: up to $250 buying from Ali
**Downside**: wait 3-6 weeks for shipping

### Used Equipment
Save 30-50% buying used:
- LED panels (check diodes work)
- Tents (inspect for tears)
- Fans (listen for noise)

**Don't buy used**:
- Carbon filters (may be worn out)
- pH meters (lose calibration)
- Seeds (may not germinate)

## Budget Recommendations

### If budget $200-400
→ **Minimal starter**
→ Autos in 2×2' tent
→ No filter (add later)

### If budget $500-800
→ **Optimal option** (recommended!)
→ Photos in 3×3' tent
→ With filter and controller

### If budget $1000-2000+
→ **Advanced setup**
→ But if beginner — start with optimal
→ Upgrade after 2-3 grows

## Budget Planning Mistakes

❌ **Buying cheapest light** → plants stretch, yield 2x smaller
❌ **Saving on ventilation** → overheating, mold, lost harvest
❌ **Forgetting supplies** → no money for nutrients mid-grow
❌ **Buying top equipment without experience** → can't appreciate difference, overpay
❌ **Ignoring electricity bill** → surprise at month end

## Growie's Tip

For first grow, I recommend the **optimal budget** ($500-800). It's the sweet spot: enough equipment for stable results, but not overpaying for features you won't appreciate as beginner. After 2-3 grows, you'll know where to upgrade: light? auto-watering? CO2? Track expenses in Growie — you'll see real cost per gram and when grow pays off!
