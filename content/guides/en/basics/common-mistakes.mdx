# 15 Common Beginner Mistakes in Growing

![Beginner mistakes](/images/guides/common-mistakes.jpg)

All growers make mistakes, especially at the start. Let's cover the 15 most common ones so you can avoid them and save time, money, and stress.

## Mistake 1: Overwatering

### What Happens
Beginners water too often, thinking "more water = faster growth." Roots suffocate, rot begins.

### Signs
- 🔻 Droopy, wilted leaves
- 🔻 Soil constantly wet
- 🔻 Slow growth
- 🔻 Yellow lower leaves

### Why It's a Mistake
- Roots need oxygen
- Constant moisture = no wet-dry cycle
- Risk of root rot

### How to Avoid
✅ Water only when top 1-2 inches of soil are dry
✅ Pot feels light when lifted
✅ Use fabric pots (better drainage)
✅ Rule: better to underwater than overwater

## Mistake 2: Nutrient Burn

### What Happens
"More nutrients = bigger yield!" — no, it's poisoning.

### Signs
- 🔥 Leaf tips "burned" (brown, curled)
- 🔥 Dark green leaves (nitrogen excess)
- 🔥 Stunted growth

### Why It's a Mistake
- Plants can't absorb too many nutrients
- EC/PPM in medium skyrockets
- Micronutrient toxicity

### How to Avoid
✅ Start with 1/4-1/2 recommended dose
✅ Increase gradually
✅ Monitor EC: veg 1.0-1.4, flower 1.2-1.8
✅ Flush medium with clean water every 2-3 weeks

## Mistake 3: Wrong pH

### What Happens
pH not checked → plants can't absorb nutrients, even if sufficient.

### Signs
- 🧪 Micronutrient deficiencies (yellow leaves, spots)
- 🧪 Slow growth
- 🧪 Plant "starving" despite feeding

### Why It's a Mistake
- pH affects nutrient availability
- Wrong pH = nutrient lockout

**Optimal pH**:
- Soil: 6.0-6.5
- Coco: 5.5-6.5
- Hydro: 5.5-6.0

### How to Avoid
✅ Buy pH meter ($15-30)
✅ Calibrate monthly
✅ Check pH every watering
✅ Use pH buffers (pH Up/Down)

## Mistake 4: Light Too Close

### What Happens
"More light = faster growth!" — until leaves burn.

### Signs
- 💡 Leaves curling up (taco leaves)
- 💡 Yellow/white spots on top leaves
- 💡 Growth slows
- 💡 Bleached buds (white, no smell)

### Why It's a Mistake
- Light stress
- Leaf overheating
- Chlorophyll degradation

### How to Avoid
✅ Follow recommended distances:
  - LED 100W: 12-18 inches (30-45cm)
  - LED 240W: 16-24 inches (40-60cm)
  - HPS 400W: 20-28 inches (50-70cm)
✅ Hand test: if hot for you = hot for plant
✅ Measure PPFD if possible (veg 400-600, flower 600-900)

## Mistake 5: Early Harvest

### What Happens
Impatience! Beginners cut plants 1-3 weeks early.

### Signs
- ⏱️ Most pistils still white
- ⏱️ Trichomes clear (not milky/amber)
- ⏱️ Buds fluffy

### Why It's a Mistake
- Lose 20-40% final weight
- Weak effects
- Unpleasant taste

### How to Avoid
✅ Use 60x loupe or microscope
✅ Wait until 70-90% pistils darken
✅ Trichomes: 70% milky + 20-30% amber
✅ Patience! Last 2 weeks = +30% weight

## Mistake 6: Poor Ventilation

### What Happens
Saving on fan or no fan at all.

### Signs
- 🌬️ High temperature (>8gt;86°F / 30°C)
- 🌬️ High humidity (>7gt;70%)
- 🌬️ Stagnant air
- 🌬️ Mold on buds

### Why It's a Mistake
- Overheating → heat stress
- High humidity → mold, rot
- No circulation → weak stems

### How to Avoid
✅ Inline fan with CFM reserve
✅ 1-2 circulation fans inside
✅ Intake vents open
✅ Negative pressure (walls sucked in)

## Mistake 7: Ignoring Smell

### What Happens
"Smell not strong, will be fine" → neighbors knocking in week of flowering.

### Signs
- 👃 Smell noticeable outside door/on stairs
- 👃 Guests asking "what's that smell?"
- 👃 Neighbor complaints

### Why It's a Mistake
- Flowering cannabis smells intensely
- Smell travels several floors
- Legal risks

### How to Avoid
✅ Carbon filter — essential!
✅ Install BEFORE flowering starts
✅ Negative pressure in tent
✅ ONA Gel in room (not in tent!)

## Mistake 8: Too Many Plants in Small Tent

### What Happens
"I'll plant 6 in 3×3' tent, bigger yield!" → plants choking each other.

### Signs
- 🌱 Plants touching each other
- 🌱 Lower branches get no light
- 🌱 High humidity (no circulation)
- 🌱 Plants thin, stretched

### Why It's a Mistake
- Poor air circulation
- Light competition
- Mold risk
- Total yield less than with 2-3 plants

### How to Avoid
✅ Tent 2×2': 1-2 plants
✅ Tent 3×3': 2-3 plants
✅ Tent 4×4': 3-4 plants
✅ Better fewer plants with longer veg

## Mistake 9: Stress During Flower Transition

### What Happens
Switching light 18/6 → 12/12, but with light leaks at night or inconsistent schedule.

### Signs
- 🌙 Plant hermies (male flowers appear)
- 🌙 Flowering doesn't start
- 🌙 Revegetation (back to veg)

### Why It's a Mistake
- Light leaks disrupt schedule
- Stress → hermaphrodites → seeds in buds
- Inconsistent schedule confuses plant

### How to Avoid
✅ Absolute darkness at night (check LEDs, timer lights)
✅ Consistent schedule: 12/12 same time daily
✅ Use timer outlet
✅ Don't enter tent at night!

## Mistake 10: Panic at First Problems

### What Happens
See yellow leaf → panic → change everything at once → worse.

### Signs
- 😱 Beginner changes nutrients, light, watering simultaneously
- 😱 Plant stressed from sudden changes
- 😱 Can't tell what helped, what hurt

### Why It's a Mistake
- 1-2 yellow lower leaves — normal
- Sudden changes = additional stress
- Need time to adapt (3-7 days)

### How to Avoid
✅ Observe 3-5 days before changes
✅ Change only 1 parameter at a time
✅ Document changes in diary
✅ Ask experienced growers on forum (show photos!)

## Mistake 11: Using Tap Water Without Settling

### What Happens
Water straight from tap → chlorine kills beneficial bacteria in soil.

### Signs
- 💧 Slow growth
- 💧 Micronutrient deficiencies
- 💧 Root problems

### Why It's a Mistake
- Chlorine in water kills microbiome
- Cold water = root stress
- High PPM water (>3gt;300) can block nutrients

### How to Avoid
✅ Let water sit 24-48 hours (chlorine evaporates)
✅ Use room temperature water
✅ Check water PPM (should be &lt;200)
✅ If PPM &gt;300, use filter or bottled water

## Mistake 12: High Humidity Late Flower

### What Happens
Humidity &gt;60% in final weeks → mold on dense buds.

### Signs
- 🍄 Bud rot (gray rot inside buds)
- 🍄 White mold (powdery mildew)
- 🍄 Lost harvest

### Why It's a Mistake
- Dense buds + high humidity = perfect mold environment
- Mold can destroy entire harvest in 3-5 days

### How to Avoid
✅ Lower humidity in flower:
  - Early flower: 50-55%
  - Mid flower: 45-50%
  - Late flower: 40-45%
  - Final 2 weeks: 35-40%
✅ Use dehumidifier if needed
✅ Increase ventilation and circulation

## Mistake 13: Too Short Veg

### What Happens
"I'll flip to flower after 2 weeks veg, faster harvest!" → microscopic plants.

### Signs
- 🌿 Plant 6-10 inches (15-25cm) tall
- 🌿 Few branches
- 🌿 Yield 10-30g (could be 100g+)

### Why It's a Mistake
- Plant doubles in size during stretch
- Short veg = small plant = small yield
- Wasting genetic potential

### How to Avoid
✅ Minimum 4 weeks veg (better 6-8)
✅ Wait for 4-6 pairs of true leaves
✅ Height 12-20 inches (30-50cm) before flip
✅ Plant should look healthy and strong

## Mistake 14: Improper Drying

### What Happens
Cut → hung on heater / under fan → dried in 2 days → harvest smells like hay.

### Signs
- 🍂 Hay smell
- 🍂 Harsh/unpleasant taste
- 🍂 Brittle, crumbling buds

### Why It's a Mistake
- Too fast drying destroys terpenes
- No chlorophyll degradation
- Taste and smell lost forever

### How to Avoid
✅ Dry 10-14 days
✅ Temperature: 65-70°F (18-21°C)
✅ Humidity: 55-65%
✅ Darkness
✅ Gentle circulation (not directly on buds)
✅ Ready when stems snap but don't break

## Mistake 15: Skipping Cure

### What Happens
Dried → straight to smoking → disappointed in taste and effects.

### Signs
- 🏺 Harsh taste
- 🏺 Weak effects
- 🏺 Smell not developed

### Why It's a Mistake
- Cure improves taste 2-3x
- Effects become smoother and stronger
- Terpenes develop

### How to Avoid
✅ After drying — into jars
✅ Jar humidity 60-65% (use Boveda 62% hygrometer)
✅ Burp (open jars) first week 2x daily for 10 minutes
✅ Minimum 2 weeks cure, ideal 4-8 weeks
✅ Store in dark cool place

## Bonus: Mindset Mistakes

**❌ "I'll watch YouTube and understand everything"**
→ Theory ≠ practice, need experience

**❌ "I'll buy cheapest equipment"**
→ Cheap light = small yield (lost money)

**❌ "Don't need diary, I'll remember"**
→ Forget in a week, can't fix mistakes

**❌ "I'll try 10 plants of different strains"**
→ Can't tell what worked, what didn't

**❌ "Won't ask, will figure it out"**
→ Waste time and harvest when could have asked

## Growie's Tip

Main beginner mistake — impatience and over-intervention. Plants aren't computers, they don't respond instantly to changes. Observe, wait 3-5 days, analyze. Keep detailed diary in Growie: you'll see patterns and understand which actions led to results. Remember: mistakes are part of learning, everyone went through this!
