# Indoor vs Outdoor: Which to Choose?

![Indoor and outdoor growing](/images/guides/indoor-vs-outdoor.jpg)

The first question for any beginner grower: should you grow indoors or outdoors? Each approach has distinct advantages, disadvantages, and requirements. Let's break down both options in detail.

## Quick Comparison

| Parameter | Indoor | Outdoor |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Control** | Complete | Minimal |
| **Yield per plant** | 50-150g | 200-1000g |
| **Quality** | Very high | High |
| **Startup cost** | $300-1500 | $50-200 |
| **Electricity costs** | High ($30-100/mo) | None |
| **Cycles per year** | 3-6 | 1 |
| **Stealth** | High | Low |
| **Difficulty** | Medium-high | Low-medium |
| **Pest risk** | Low | High |
| **Climate dependency** | None | Complete |

## Indoor Growing

### What it is
A fully controlled environment in an enclosed space: grow box, tent, room, or garage.

### Pros ✅

**1. Complete climate control**
- Temperature, humidity, light — all adjustable
- Weather-independent year-round
- Continuous growing cycles

**2. Premium quality**
- Perfect conditions = maximum potency
- Beautiful dense buds
- Fewer contaminants and pollutants

**3. Multiple harvests per year**
- Photoperiod: 3-4 harvests per year
- Autoflowers: 4-6 harvests per year
- Perpetual grow cycles possible

**4. Stealth**
- Neighbors can't see
- Smell controlled with carbon filter
- Safer legally (if discreet grow)

**5. Pest protection**
- Fewer insects
- Controlled environment
- Easier to manage problems

**6. Predictability**
- Precise harvest planning
- Consistent results
- Lower risk

### Cons ❌

**1. High initial costs**
- Grow tent: $100-300
- LED/HPS light: $100-500
- Ventilation + filter: $100-200
- Total: **$300-1500** to start

**2. Electricity bills**
- LED 200W × 18 hours × 30 days = 108 kWh ≈ $15-30/month
- HPS 400W × 18 hours = 216 kWh ≈ $30-60/month
- Ventilation, heating, dehumidifier — add +$10-40

**3. Requires attention**
- Daily monitoring
- Watering, feeding, adjustments
- Can't leave for long without automation

**4. Smaller yield per plant**
- Limited space
- 50-150g per plant (indoor)
- vs 200-1000g outdoors

**5. Learning curve**
- Equipment knowledge needed
- Mistakes can be expensive
- 2-3 grows to master

**6. Fire risk**
- Electrical equipment running 18-24 hours
- Proper wiring required
- Fire safety critical

### When to choose indoor?

✅ Living in apartment or city
✅ No access to safe outdoor space
✅ Want year-round harvests
✅ Stealth is important
✅ Ready to invest in equipment
✅ Want premium quality

## Outdoor Growing

### What it is
Growing under natural sunlight on property, in greenhouse, or on balcony.

### Pros ✅

**1. Free light**
- Sun = best light source
- Full spectrum
- Zero electricity costs

**2. Huge yields**
- 200-1000g per plant
- No height limitations
- Plants can reach 10-13 feet (3-4 meters)

**3. Low costs**
- Seeds: $30-50
- Pot and soil: $20-50
- Nutrients: $30-100
- Total: **$50-200** for entire cycle

**4. Simplicity**
- Nature does most of the work
- Less equipment
- Easier for beginners

**5. Natural growth**
- Plants develop naturally
- Less stress
- Natural terpene profile

**6. Eco-friendly**
- No electricity
- Minimal carbon footprint
- Easier organic growing

### Cons ❌

**1. Climate dependent**
- Only 1 season per year (spring-fall)
- Weather can ruin harvest
- Suitable climate required

**2. Low stealth**
- Visible to neighbors, passersby
- Smell spreads hundreds of yards
- Theft risk

**3. Pests and diseases**
- Insects, fungi, mold
- Harder to control
- Can destroy entire harvest

**4. No control**
- Can't change weather
- Rain, wind, hail
- Early frost

**5. Legal risks**
- Visibility = risk
- Neighbors may complain
- Depends on local laws

**6. One harvest per year**
- Plant in May
- Harvest in September-October
- Long waiting period

### When to choose outdoor?

✅ Have private property or safe location
✅ Live in suitable climate (warm summer)
✅ Want large harvest
✅ Limited budget
✅ Legality not an issue
✅ Willing to wait until fall

## Hybrid Option: Greenhouse

### What it is
Enclosed structure outdoors with natural light but partial climate control.

### Pros
✅ Free solar light
✅ Protection from pests and weather
✅ Larger yield than indoor
✅ Humidity and temperature control
✅ Extended season (earlier spring, later fall)

### Cons
❌ Requires building greenhouse ($200-2000)
❌ Need property
❌ Visibility (unless hidden greenhouse)
❌ Still season-dependent

### When to choose greenhouse?
✅ Have property but cool climate
✅ Want to combine indoor and outdoor advantages
✅ Ready to invest in greenhouse

## Balcony/Guerrilla — Intermediate Options

### Balcony

**Pros**:
- Access to sun without property
- Relative stealth
- Cheaper than indoor

**Cons**:
- Limited space
- Neighbors may see/smell
- Depends on sun exposure

**When suitable**: apartment with south-facing balcony, friendly neighbors

### Guerrilla Growing

**What it is**: growing in wild locations (forest, field, abandoned areas)

**Pros**:
- Free
- Stealth from neighbors
- Not your property = less legal risk (debatable)

**Cons**:
- High theft/discovery risk
- Can't check regularly
- Wildlife damage (deer, boars)

**When suitable**: no other option, safe wild location available

## Cost Analysis

### Indoor (1 grow, 3 months)

**Costs**:
- Equipment (first time): $500
- Electricity: $60-150
- Seeds + nutrients: $80
- **Total first grow**: $640-730

**Yield**: 100-300g

**Cost per gram**: $2.50-7.30

**Subsequent grows**: $140-230 (no equipment)

### Outdoor (1 season, 5 months)

**Costs**:
- Seeds + soil + nutrients: $100-200
- **Total**: $100-200

**Yield**: 200-1000g

**Cost per gram**: $0.10-1.00

**Conclusion**: outdoor is 5-20x cheaper per gram, but requires property and suitable climate.

## Choice for Beginners

### If limited budget
→ **Outdoor** (if have property)
→ **Balcony** (if have south-facing balcony)
→ **Mini-indoor** (compact 2×2' box for $300-400)

### If stealth important
→ **Indoor** with carbon filter

### If want maximum yield
→ **Outdoor** on property or **greenhouse**

### If want to learn and experiment
→ **Indoor** (complete control, fast cycles)

### If living in apartment
→ **Indoor** (only option)

## Combined Approach

Many experienced growers use both methods:
- **Indoor winter and spring** — maintain skills, early experiments
- **Outdoor summer** — large harvest for storage

This gives you:
✅ Year-round growing
✅ Diverse experience
✅ Large summer harvest + winter experiments

## Growie's Tip

For beginners, I recommend starting with **indoor**, even if you have property. Why? Indoor gives complete control, fast cycles (learn from mistakes in 3 months, not a season), and predictable results. After mastering indoor in 2-3 grows, move to outdoor in summer — you'll already understand the plant and can achieve huge yields. Track both methods in Growie to compare results!
