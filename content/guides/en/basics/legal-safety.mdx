![Growing safety](/images/guides/legal-safety.jpg)

Before starting a grow, it's important to understand legal risks and safety measures. This guide is for informational purposes — you make your own decisions.

## Legal Status by Country

### Fully Legal (Recreational)

**Personal cultivation permitted**:
- 🇨🇦 **Canada**: up to 4 plants per household
- 🇺🇾 **Uruguay**: up to 6 plants
- 🇿🇦 **South Africa**: personal cultivation legalized (amount not specified)
- 🇲🇹 **Malta**: up to 4 plants
- 🇱🇺 **Luxembourg**: up to 4 plants
- 🇩🇪 **Germany**: up to 3 plants (from 2024)

## Risks and Penalties (General)

### Administrative Liability
- Fines
- Registration
- Community service

### Criminal Liability
- Imprisonment
- Large fines
- Criminal record

**Factors affecting penalty**:
- Number of plants
- Harvest weight
- Presence of distribution equipment (scales, baggies)
- Previous offenses

## Safety Rules

### Rule 1: Tell No One

**"Loose lips sink ships"** — most common cause of getting caught.

❌ **Don't tell**:
- Friends (even closest)
- Colleagues
- Neighbors
- Internet (from personal account)

✅ **Can tell**:
- Only partner/spouse (if 100% trust)
- Anonymous forums (with VPN)

**Why important**: 90% of arrests — from "friend told friend."

### Rule 2: No Smells

**Smell = main cause of discovery**

✅ **Smell control**:
- Carbon filter (essential!)
- Negative pressure in tent
- ONA Gel in room (not in tent)
- Close doors when entering/exiting
- Don't take out smelly trash (bag in bag)

❌ **What gives away**:
- Smell on stairs/in building
- Smell from ventilation
- Clothes with terpene smell

### Rule 3: Noise Control

**Fan noise 24/7 attracts attention**

✅ **Noise reduction**:
- Quiet fans (AC Infinity, Soler & Palau)
- Duct silencers
- Vibration isolation (hang on straps)
- Run fan at 50-70% (controller)

### Rule 4: Stealth

**Grow should be invisible**

❌ **What gives away**:
- Bright light from window at night
- Thermal imaging (infrared camera)
- High electricity bill (sudden spike)
- Frequent grow equipment deliveries

✅ **Solutions**:
- Blackout curtains/blinds
- Grow in windowless room or covered window
- LED instead of HPS (less heat)
- Reasonable power consumption
- Order equipment to different places/names

### Rule 5: Electrical Safety

**Fire = calling firefighters = discovery**

✅ **Rules**:
- Never overload outlets
- Use quality surge protectors
- Check wiring (heat, melting)
- Smoke alarm in room
- Fire extinguisher nearby
- Don't leave grow unattended long

**Load calculation**:
```
LED 240W + fan 60W + circulation 30W = 330W = ~1.5A
Safe for 16A outlet (up to 3500W)
```

**Dangerous**:
- HPS 600W + heater 1500W = 2100W = ~10A (close to limit!)

### Rule 6: Digital Security

**Internet = trail**

✅ **Safe behavior**:
- Use VPN for orders and forums
- Anonymous usernames (not linked to you)
- Don't post photos with metadata (EXIF)
- Cryptocurrency for payment (if possible)
- Separate email for grow orders

❌ **Dangerous**:
- Post grow on Instagram/Facebook from personal account
- Order to work address
- Talk about hobby on social media

## Stealth Growing (Complete Concealment)

### Location

**Best places for tent**:
- Walk-in closet / storage room
- Attic / basement
- Bedroom corner (disguised as wardrobe)
- Garage (if heated)

**Bad places**:
- Room with windows to street
- Places with frequent guests
- Near shared walls (neighbors hear)

### Camouflage

**Ideas for hiding tent**:
- Converted wardrobe / closet
- "Server room" with computers (explains noise and light)
- Hobby room (for "tomato seedlings")
- Storage room with lock

**What to say when questioned**:
- "Growing tomatoes/peppers"
- "Mining servers" (explains noise)
- "Meat drying chamber" (explains smell)

### Electricity Bill Control

**How much will bill increase?**

LED 240W × 18 hours × 30 days = 130 kWh ≈ +$15-25 per month

**Is it noticeable?**
- For 500-1000 sq ft apartment: no (normal use 150-300 kWh)
- For small apartment: may be noticeable (+30-50%)

**How to reduce suspicion**:
- Use LED (not HPS)
- Autos 20/4 instead of photo 18/6
- One grow at a time (not perpetual)

## Risks When Renting

**Additional risks**:
- Landlord may enter without notice
- Neighbors complain more often
- Meter inspections

**Precautions**:
- Grow only in long-term rental (year+)
- Don't give landlord keys to room with tent
- Ensure soundproofing and smell control
- Consider insurance for lost deposit

## What to Do If Problems Arise

### If Police Arrive

**❌ Don't**:
- Don't open door without warrant
- Don't say anything without lawyer
- Don't give consent to search voluntarily

**✅ Do**:
- Ask: "Do you have a warrant?"
- Call lawyer (find contacts beforehand)
- Record everything on video (if possible)
- Remain silent (right not to incriminate yourself)

### If Fire Occurs

1. Evacuate
2. Call firefighters (life more important)
3. Don't return to premises
4. Prepare for consequences (firefighters will see tent)

## Alternatives: Legal Growing

### Medical Licenses

In countries with medical cannabis:
- Get medical card
- Legally grow by limit
- Depends on diagnosis and region

### Moving to Legal Region

If growing is a passion, consider moving:
- Canada, Uruguay — fully legal
- Legal US states (Colorado, California)
- Netherlands, Spain — tolerance

## Ethics and Responsibility

**Personal growing vs selling**:
- Personal growing = low risk (if stealthy)
- Selling = high risk (dealing)

**Don't sell**:
- To minors
- Without quality control
- In large volumes

**Be responsible**:
- Store out of children's reach
- Don't drive under influence
- Don't create problems for neighbors

## Growie's Tip

If growing is illegal in your region, weigh all risks. Growing is responsibility, not a game. Main rules: tell no one, control smell, be careful. If legal — enjoy the hobby! Use Growie for private diary (with password) — you'll keep information safe but protected.
