# Equipment Checklist for Your First Grow

![Growing equipment](/images/guides/equipment-checklist.jpg)

Before your first grow, you need to assemble basic equipment. Let's cover three tiers: minimal starter, optimal system, and advanced setup.

## Tier 1: Minimal Starter ($200-350)

For those wanting to try with minimal investment.

### Essential Equipment

**1. Growing Space**
- ☐ **Grow tent 2×2' or 3×3'** ($80-150)
  - Alternative: converted closet, storage room
  - Requirement: light-proof

**2. Lighting**
- ☐ **LED panel 100-150W** ($50-100)
  - Full spectrum (white light)
  - Hangers included
  - Alternative: CFL bulbs 200W

**3. Ventilation**
- ☐ **Inline fan 4" (100mm)** ($30-60)
  - 100-150 CFM
  - No filter (smell tolerable first weeks)
- ☐ **Circulation fan** ($15-25)
  - Clip-on or desk fan

**4. Pots and Medium**
- ☐ **Fabric pots 2-3 gallon** ($10-20 for 3-5)
- ☐ **Soil** ($15-30)
  - BioBizz Light Mix, Plagron Light Mix

  - Feminized (female only)

### Total: $250-360

**Can skip initially**:
- Carbon filter (add before flowering)

- Professional-level yields

## Staged Purchasing (Smart Approach)

### First Grow — Buy Minimum
**Budget**: $250-360
- Tent 2×2' or 3×3'
- LED 100-150W
- Fan without filter
- Basic nutrients
- Auto seeds

**Why**: understand process without big investment

### Second Grow — Add Quality
**Budget**: +$200-300
- Carbon filter (smell is issue now)
- More powerful LED or larger tent
- EC meter

**Why**: now you know what works, improve weak points

### Third Grow — Automation
**Budget**: +$200-500
- Thermostat controller
- Auto-watering (if tired of watering)
- Dehumidifier (if had mold)

**Why**: optimization, less time on grow

## Where to Buy

### International Stores
- **AliExpress** — cheap LEDs, fans, tents
  - Con: long shipping (2-6 weeks)
  - Pro: 2-3x cheaper prices
- **Amazon** — fast delivery, wide selection
  - AC Infinity, Spider Farmer, Vivosun
  - Easy returns

### Local Grow Shops
- Personal consultation
- See in person
- Usually 20-40% more expensive

### Specialized Sites
- **Growershouse.com** (USA)
- **Grow-shop.eu** (Europe)
- **Hydrostore.co.uk** (UK)

**Tip**: Buy LEDs, fans, tents on AliExpress. Buy seeds, nutrients, meters locally.

## What NOT to Buy Initially

❌ **CO2 system** — only after 3-4 grows
❌ **Expensive boosters** — basic nutrients more important
❌ **Many seeds** — start with 2-3 plants
❌ **Hydroponic systems** — complex for beginners
❌ **Ozone generators** — dangerous, use carbon filter
❌ **UV sterilizers** — excessive for home grow

## Harvest Tools (Buy Before Cutting)

- ☐ **Trim scissors** ($20-50)
  - Chikamasa B-500SRF — best
- ☐ **Drying rack** ($15-30)
  - For drying buds
- ☐ **Glass jars** ($10-20)
  - For curing
- ☐ **Hygrometer for jar** ($10-15)
  - Monitor humidity during cure

## Optional Upgrades

### For Better Results
- **Mycorrhizae** ($15-30) — healthy roots
- **Silica supplements** ($20-40) — strong stems
- **Enzymes** ($20-30) — break down dead roots
- **Circulation fans (2-3)** ($30-60) — better air flow

### For Convenience
- **Watering can with long spout** ($10-20)
- **pH buffers (up/down)** ($10-20)
- **Timer outlets (2-3)** ($20-40)
- **Calibration solution for pH** ($10-15)

## Safety

☐ **Surge protector** ($20-30)
☐ **Smoke alarm** ($15-25)
☐ **Fire extinguisher** ($20-40)

**Important**: never overload outlets! HPS 600W + fan + heater = &gt;10A load.

## Pre-Grow Checklist

### Week Before Start
- ✅ All equipment unpacked and tested
- ✅ Tent assembled, fan installed
- ✅ LED hung at correct height
- ✅ pH meter calibrated
- ✅ Soil prepared (moistened, settled)

### Start Day
- ✅ Seeds germinated (tail 0.5-1cm)
- ✅ Tent temperature 72-77°F (22-25°C)
- ✅ Humidity 65-75%
- ✅ Light on (timer 18/6)
- ✅ Fan running
- ✅ Water pH 6.0-6.5 ready

## Common Equipment Mistakes

❌ **Buying weak light** — LED 50W for 4×4' tent (need minimum 200W)
❌ **Ignoring ventilation** — "it'll be fine" → overheating and mold
❌ **Cheap pH meter without calibration** → wrong readings
❌ **Buying everything top-tier immediately** → waste $2000 without experience
❌ **No carbon filter** → neighbors smelled from 3 floors away
❌ **Too small tent** — plants didn't fit during stretch

## Growie's Tip

Start with the minimal set for $250-350. Don't buy premium equipment without experience — you won't appreciate the difference on first grow. After first harvest, you'll understand what's missing: light? ventilation? auto-watering? Then upgrade specifically. Use Growie to track equipment costs and calculate cost per gram — you'll see when the grow pays off!
