# Cannabis Lifecycle

![Cannabis lifecycle](/images/guides/cannabis-lifecycle.jpg)

Understanding the plant's lifecycle is key to successful growing. Each stage has specific requirements for light, nutrients, watering, and climate.

## Full Cycle Timeline

| Stage | Duration | Light Schedule |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Germination | 1-7 days | Not required |
| Seedling | 1-3 weeks | 18/6 or 20/4 |
| Vegetation | 3-8 weeks | 18/6 |
| Pre-flowering | 1-2 weeks | 12/12 |
| Flowering | 6-10 weeks | 12/12 |
| **Total** | **12-24 weeks** | — |

**Important**:
- **Autoflowers**: 8-12 weeks (light-independent)
- **Photoperiod**: 12-24 weeks (require 12/12 for flowering)

## Stage 1: Germination

### Duration: 1-7 days (usually 2-3)

**What happens**: Seed swells, taproot emerges, cotyledons appear

**Conditions**:
- Temperature: 72-77°F
- Humidity: 70-90%
- Light: not required until sprout
- Medium: wet paper towels, peat pellets, rockwool

### Signs of Success
✅ White taproot 0.2-0.4 inches
✅ Cotyledons opened
✅ Straight green stem

## Stage 2: Seedling

### Duration: 1-3 weeks

**What happens**: First true leaves develop, roots strengthen, photosynthesis begins

**Conditions**:
- Temperature: 72-77°F (day), 64-72°F (night)
- Humidity: 65-75%
- Light: 18/6 or 20/4, soft light (200-400 PPFD)
- Water: careful, small amounts
- Nutrients: not needed or 1/4 dose

### Signs of Health
✅ Bright green leaves
✅ Thick strong stem
✅ New leaves every 1-2 days

## Stage 3: Vegetation

### Duration: 3-8 weeks (depends on target size)

**What happens**: Rapid stem and leaf growth, side branches form, green mass accumulates

**Conditions**:
- Temperature: 72-82°F (day), 64-75°F (night)
- Humidity: 50-70%
- Light: 18/6, bright light (400-600 PPFD)
- Water: regular, when top layer dried
- Nutrients: focus on nitrogen (N) for green mass

### Training Techniques
- **Topping** — cutting top for branching
- **LST** — bending branches for even growth
- **Defoliation** — removing lower leaves for airflow

### When to Switch to Flower?
- Height: reached 30-50% of desired size (plant will double in flower)
- Nodes: 4-6+ pairs of true leaves
- Age: minimum 3-4 weeks veg

## Stage 4: Pre-Flowering

### Duration: 1-2 weeks after switching to 12/12

**What happens**: Plant switches to reproductive stage, first sex signs appear, rapid vertical stretch

**Conditions**:
- Temperature: 72-82°F (day), 68-75°F (night)
- Humidity: 50-60%
- Light: 12/12 (mandatory!)
- Nutrients: gradual transition from nitrogen (N) to phosphorus-potassium (PK)

### Sex Determination

**Female plants (keep)**:
- White hairs (pistils) at nodes
- "Whiskers" stick out from calyxes

**Male plants (remove)**:
- Small balls (pollen sacs)
- Clusters of "balls" without hairs

**Important**: remove males BEFORE pollen sacs open!

## Stage 5: Flowering

### Duration: 6-10 weeks (strain dependent)

**By strain type**:
- Indica: 6-8 weeks
- Sativa: 9-12 weeks
- Hybrids: 7-9 weeks

### Flowering Sub-Stages

#### Early Flowering (1-3 weeks)
- Bud formation begins
- White pistils actively grow
- Smell develops

**Conditions**:
- Temperature: 72-79°F
- Humidity: 45-55%
- Nutrients: high phosphorus (P) and potassium (K)

#### Mid Flowering (4-6 weeks)
- Buds rapidly gain mass
- Covered with trichomes (resin)
- Smell intensifies
- Maximum water consumption

**Conditions**:
- Temperature: 68-79°F
- Humidity: 40-50%
- Nutrients: peak PK, add bloom booster

#### Late Flowering (7-10 weeks)
- Buds dense
- Pistils darken (white → orange/brown)
- Trichomes change color (clear → milky → amber)
- Water consumption decreases

**Conditions**:
- Temperature: 64-75°F (lower improves color)
- Humidity: 35-45%
- Nutrients: reduce dose, prepare for flush

### Ripeness Signs

**Ready for harvest**:
✅ 70-90% pistils darkened
✅ Trichomes: 70% milky, 20-30% amber
✅ Leaves yellowing (natural senescence)
✅ Dense resinous buds

## Stage 6: Final Week (Flush)

### Duration: 1-2 weeks before harvest

**What happens**: Flush substrate with clean water, plant uses stored nutrients, improves final taste

**Conditions**:
- Water: clean water only (pH 6.0-6.5)
- Light: can lower to 10/14 or even 48 hours darkness before cut
- Temperature: 64-72°F

## Autoflowers vs Photoperiod

### Autoflowers

**Features**:
- Light-independent (flower by age)
- Total cycle: 8-12 weeks
- Light schedule: 18/6 or 20/4 entire cycle
- Smaller size and yield

**Stages**:
- Seedling: 1-2 weeks
- Veg: 2-4 weeks
- Flowering: 5-7 weeks

### Photoperiod

**Features**:
- Light-dependent (flower at 12/12)
- Total cycle: 12-24 weeks
- Can keep on veg indefinitely
- Larger size and yield

**Stages**:
- Seedling: 1-3 weeks
- Veg: 3-8+ weeks (grower controlled)
- Flowering: 6-10 weeks

## Common Mistakes by Stage

**Seedling**:
❌ Too strong light → burns
❌ Overwatering → fungus, root rot
❌ Nutrients too early → burn

**Veg**:
❌ Too short veg → small yield
❌ Too long veg → plant doesn't fit box during stretch
❌ Weak light → stretching

**Flowering**:
❌ Light leaks → stress, hermies
❌ High humidity → mold on buds
❌ Early harvest → weak effect
❌ Late harvest → sleepy effect

## Growie Tip

Don't rush switching to flower — let plant develop well on veg (minimum 4 weeks). Strong veg = big yield. And don't rush harvest — use microscope to check trichomes, it guarantees optimal effect. Keep diary in Growie to track stages and not miss important moments!
