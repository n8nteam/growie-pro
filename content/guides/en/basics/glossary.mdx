## Growie's Tip

Don't be afraid to use this glossary when reading guides and forums. Growers love abbreviations and slang, but everyone was a beginner once. Save this glossary to bookmarks and return when you encounter unfamiliar terms. Growie has built-in glossary in the app — use it for quick term lookup!
