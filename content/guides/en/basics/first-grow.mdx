# Your First Grow: Step-by-Step Guide

![First Grow](/images/guides/seedling.jpg)

Welcome to the world of indoor gardening! This guide will walk you through the entire process — from setting up your space to harvesting.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Space

Before you begin, choose a growing area:

- **Grow tent** — the most popular option for beginners (2×2, 3×3, or 4×4 ft)
- **Spare room** — if you have a free room available
- **Grow box** — compact option for a single plant

### What you'll need:

- Tent or enclosed space
- Light (LED panel from 100W)
- Ventilation (inline fan + carbon filter)
- Pots (2-5 gallons)
- Growing medium (soil or coco)
- Nutrients
- Thermohygrometer

## Step 2: Choose Your Seeds

For your first grow, we recommend **autoflowering varieties** — they're easier to manage and finish faster (8-10 weeks from seed to harvest).

What to look for:
- **Genetics** — choose from reputable seed banks
- **Type** — autoflower for your first time
- **Size** — compact varieties for smaller spaces

## Step 3: Germination

1. Soak seeds in a glass of water for 12-24 hours
2. Transfer to a damp paper towel between two plates
3. After 24-48 hours, a taproot will appear
4. Plant in prepared medium at 0.5-1 inch depth

## Step 4: Seedling Stage (Weeks 1-2)

- Light: 18 hours per day
- Temperature: 73-77°F (23-25°C)
- Humidity: 65-70%
- Watering: minimal, don't overwater

## Step 5: Vegetative Stage (Weeks 2-4)

- Light: 18-20 hours per day
- Temperature: 72-82°F (22-28°C)
- Humidity: 50-60%
- Start feeding nutrients (1/4 strength)
- Gradually increase watering

## Step 6: Flowering (Weeks 4-8)

- Light: 12/12 for photoperiod, 18-20 for autos
- Temperature: 68-79°F (20-26°C)
- Humidity: 40-50%
- Switch to bloom nutrients
- Monitor trichomes

## Step 7: Harvest

Determine readiness by trichomes:
- **Clear** — too early
- **Cloudy/milky** — peak maturity
- **Amber** — overripe

Cut the plant, remove large fan leaves, and hang to dry for 7-14 days at 64-72°F (18-22°C) and 55-62% humidity.

## Tips for Beginners

1. **Don't overwater** — this is the #1 beginner mistake
2. **Don't overfeed** — less is more with nutrients
3. **Keep a diary** — log everything you do (Growie is perfect for this!)
4. **Be patient** — plants need time
5. **Monitor pH** — optimal is 6.0-6.5 for soil

Happy growing!
