# Double Parabola Reflector Blueprint

The double parabola reflector is one of the most effective reflector designs for high-intensity discharge lamps. Its geometry provides uniform light distribution across the growing area with minimal losses. In this article we will cover the math, the construction, and a step-by-step build guide.

## What Is a Double Parabola

A standard parabolic reflector has a single parabolic surface with the lamp positioned at its focal point. A double parabola consists of two parabolic profiles offset from each other. The lamp sits not at the focus of a single parabola but between the foci of two parabolas.

How it works: each of the two parabolas reflects light not straight down (as it would if the source were at the focus) but at an angle -- outward and downward. The two reflected beams overlap, forming a wide and uniform light footprint.

## Why the Double Parabola Is Effective

A conventional parabolic reflector with the lamp at its focus produces a narrow directed beam with a sharp center peak. This creates a problem: plants directly under the lamp receive too much light (potentially causing light stress), while plants at the edges receive too little.

The double parabola addresses this by:

- Widening the light footprint without losing intensity
- Redistributing energy from the center to the edges
- Reducing peak temperature directly under the lamp
- Achieving a light utilization factor of 92-95%

By measurement, a double parabola achieves a maximum-to-minimum illumination ratio in the growing zone of no more than 2:1, whereas a standard parabolic reflector can reach 5:1.

## Parabola Math

The parabolic profile is described by the equation:

y = x2 / (4f)

where f is the focal length (distance from the vertex of the parabola to the focus).

For a double parabola reflector, two parabolas with the same focal length f are offset horizontally by a distance d. The lamp is positioned midway between the two foci.

Key parameters:

- **Focal length (f)** -- determines how "open" the parabola is. A larger f means a shallower reflector and a wider footprint
- **Offset (d)** -- distance between the foci of the two parabolas. Determines the width of the overlap zone
- **Opening width (W)** -- total width of the reflector
- **Depth (H)** -- profile height from the lower edge to the apex

## Materials

### Galvanized Steel

Thickness 0.5-0.8 mm. Reflectance of galvanized steel is about 60-70%. This is a budget option that can be improved by lining the inner surface with mirror-finish aluminum tape or Mylar film. Galvanized steel holds its shape well, is easy to cut with metal shears, and bends readily.

### Aluminum Sheet

Thickness 0.5-1.0 mm. The preferred material. Mirror-finish anodized aluminum provides 85-95% reflectance. Aluminum is lighter and rust-proof but more expensive. Forming a parabolic profile requires care -- aluminum is less malleable than galvanized steel.

### Additional Materials Needed

- Steel or aluminum strip, 20x2 mm, for the frame (stiffening ribs)
- E40 ceramic socket (for HPS)
- M4 screws or rivets for assembly
- 2x0.75 mm2 cable (for socket wiring)
- Chain or cable for suspension

## Step-by-Step Build Instructions

### Step 1. Building the Template

On a large sheet of paper (poster board, wallpaper roll), draw the double parabola profile at 1:1 scale:

1. Draw a horizontal baseline
2. Mark the center -- this is the lamp position
3. From the center, measure half the offset (d/2) to the left and right -- these are the parabola foci
4. For the left parabola: starting from the left focus, plot points using the formula y = x2/(4f), where x is measured from the focus to the left
5. For the right parabola: do the same from the right focus to the right
6. Between the foci, the profile is a smooth arc connecting the vertices of both parabolas
7. At the lower edges on both sides, bend inward 10-15 mm (a lip for rigidity)

### Step 2. Cutting the Blank

Transfer the profile to the metal sheet. You need two identical profiles -- front and rear end panels -- and a rectangular sheet for the reflective surface itself.

Dimensions of the reflective surface sheet:

- Width = perimeter of the profile (measure along the template with a flexible ruler)
- Length = reflector length (see the table above)

Cut with metal shears or a jigsaw with a metal-cutting blade.

### Step 3. Forming the Profile

Lay the reflective surface sheet over the template and carefully bend it to match the profile. For aluminum, use a wooden form -- a block shaped to the parabolic profile. Bend gradually, avoiding sharp creases.

For galvanized steel, you can use progressive bending: clamp the edge in a vise and gradually form the curve, checking against the template.

### Step 4. Installing Stiffening Ribs

Bend two stiffening ribs from steel strip to match the parabolic profile. Attach them to the outer side of the reflector with rivets or M4 screws at 80-100 mm intervals. The ribs provide rigidity and prevent the reflector from warping due to heat.

### Step 5. Mounting the Socket

Drill a hole for the E40 socket at the center of the reflector (between the foci). Secure the socket through an insulating spacer made of textolite or ceramic. Route the wire through a hole in the top of the reflector.

### Step 6. Suspension System

Weld or bolt two hooks to the stiffening ribs -- symmetrically, at 1/3 of the length from each end. Hang using chain with carabiners for height adjustment.

### Step 7. Finishing

- File all sharp edges smooth
- If galvanized steel was used, line the inner surface with mirror-finish aluminum tape
- Check all electrical connections with a multimeter
- Make sure the socket is securely mounted and the wire does not touch any metal parts

## Testing and Adjustment

After assembly, turn on the lamp and check the light distribution with a lux meter at the planned working height. Measure illumination at 9 points (a 3x3 grid). The spread should not exceed 2:1 between the maximum and minimum. If the center is too bright, raise the reflector. If the edges are too dim, verify that the profile matches the blueprint.

## Summary

The double parabola is an advanced reflector design that, when built correctly, outperforms most commercial reflectors in light distribution uniformity. Material cost is modest. Build time is 3-5 hours with the right tools and metalworking skills.
