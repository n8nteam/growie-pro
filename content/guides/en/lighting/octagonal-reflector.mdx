# Octagonal Reflector

An octagonal reflector is a compromise between ease of construction and reflective efficiency. Unlike a parabolic profile, which requires precise bending along a curve, an octagon is assembled from flat panels joined at angles. Yet it is significantly better than a flat or V-shaped reflector in terms of light uniformity.

## Design Concept

The reflector is shaped as half of a regular octagon in cross-section. The lamp sits at the geometric center of the full octagon, at the level of the lower open face. Eight flat faces are angled differently relative to the horizontal plane, each reflecting light into its own zone.

If you picture the full octagon, the reflector uses the upper 4-5 faces (the lower 3-4 are open for light to pass through to the plants). In cross-section, it looks like an inverted trapezoid with additional angled segments.

### Geometry

In a regular octagon, the interior angle between adjacent faces is 135 degrees. Each reflector face is tilted at its own angle to the horizontal:

- Top center face -- horizontal (0 degrees to horizontal)
- Next faces -- 45 degrees to horizontal
- Outermost faces -- 90 degrees (vertical) or close to it

This arrangement ensures that light hitting each face is reflected at different angles, covering a wide area.

## Advantages of the Octagonal Reflector

### Light Uniformity

Thanks to multiple faces at different angles, the octagonal reflector creates a light footprint without sharp brightness variations. Each face directs light into its own sector, and these sectors overlap, producing a smooth gradient.

By measurement, the maximum-to-minimum illumination ratio in the growing zone is approximately 2.5:1 -- better than a simple V-shaped reflector (4:1), though slightly worse than a quality double parabola (2:1).

### Ease of Construction

All faces are flat. No complex curve bending is required. Simply cut rectangular strips and join them at the correct angles. This makes the design accessible for home construction with minimal tools.

### Structural Rigidity

Faces joined at angles form a rigid structure that does not deform under its own weight or from lamp heat. Additional stiffening ribs are usually not necessary.

## Dimensions

### For HPS 250W

| Element | Dimension |
|---|---|
| Opening width | 450 mm |
| Depth (profile height) | 150 mm |
| Reflector length | 450 mm |
| Top face width | 150 mm |
| Side face width | 100-120 mm |
| Face length (along slope) | 100 mm |

### For HPS 400W

| Element | Dimension |
|---|---|
| Opening width | 550 mm |
| Depth (profile height) | 180 mm |
| Reflector length | 520 mm |
| Top face width | 180 mm |
| Side face width | 120-140 mm |
| Face length (along slope) | 120 mm |

### For HPS 600W

| Element | Dimension |
|---|---|
| Opening width | 650 mm |
| Depth (profile height) | 200 mm |
| Reflector length | 600 mm |
| Top face width | 200 mm |
| Side face width | 140-160 mm |
| Face length (along slope) | 140 mm |

## Materials

You will need:

- **Aluminum sheet**, 0.5-0.8 mm thick -- the main material for the faces. Mirror-finish anodized aluminum is preferred, but plain aluminum with reflective film applied afterward also works
- **Aluminum angle**, 15x15 mm or 20x20 mm -- for joining faces together
- **Pop rivets**, 3.2 mm, or M3 bolts with nuts -- fasteners
- **E40 ceramic socket** for HPS
- **Steel suspension** -- chain or cable with adjustment

Tools:

- Metal shears or jigsaw
- Drill with a 3.5 mm bit
- Rivet gun (if using rivets)
- Ruler, square, marker
- File for deburring edges

## Building from Aluminum Sheet

### Cutting

Lay the aluminum sheet on a flat surface. Mark and cut the following parts (dimensions for HPS 400W):

1. **Top face** -- 1 piece, 180 x 520 mm
2. **Upper side faces** -- 2 pieces, 130 x 520 mm each
3. **Lower side faces** -- 2 pieces, 130 x 520 mm each
4. **End walls** -- 2 pieces, cut to the pentagonal profile

If the sheet is not wide enough, you can cut the reflector from a single piece by scoring fold lines and bending along them.

### One-Piece Construction

An alternative and simpler method -- cut the entire reflective surface from a single sheet with a width equal to the sum of all face widths (about 650 mm for HPS 400W). Mark the fold lines, score them (not all the way through) on the outer side to 1/3 of the sheet thickness, and carefully bend along the scores.

### Assembly Order

1. Bend or join the faces into the required profile
2. Check the profile against a paper template
3. Secure the end walls with rivets at 40-50 mm intervals
4. Cut a hole for the E40 socket in the center of the top face (42 mm diameter)
5. Install the socket on a ceramic spacer, secure with a nut
6. Route the wire through the hole
7. Attach two suspension loops to the top face, symmetrically placed

### Finishing

- File all edges to prevent cuts
- If unpolished aluminum was used, line the inner surfaces with mirror-finish self-adhesive film
- Verify that the socket wire does not touch any metal parts of the body
- Make sure the structure is hung securely and does not wobble

## Comparison with a Parabolic Reflector

| Parameter | Octagonal | Parabolic |
|---|---|---|
| Uniformity (max/min) | 2.5:1 | 2:1 (double parabola) |
| Build difficulty | Low | High |
| Structural rigidity | High | Medium (needs ribs) |
| Reflective efficiency | 85-90% | 90-95% |
| Build time | 1.5-2 hours | 3-5 hours |
| Material cost | Low | Moderate |
| Suitable for beginners | Yes | No |

## Usage Tips

- Periodically wipe the reflective surface with a soft cloth -- dust reduces reflectance
- Do not mount the reflector flush against the box ceiling -- leave a 5-10 cm gap for air circulation
- If using a 600W HPS, make sure the reflector is not overheating -- add an extra fan if necessary
- Optimal hanging height: for HPS 400W -- 35-45 cm from the canopy; for HPS 600W -- 40-55 cm

The octagonal reflector is an excellent choice for anyone who wants quality light reflection without complex curves or specialized tools. An hour or two of work -- and your lighting efficiency goes up by 30-40%.
