# How to Choose the Right Lamp

Choosing a lamp is a decision that will define the quality of your grow for years to come. A poor purchase will result either in bad results or a forced replacement. In this article, we'll walk through a step-by-step selection process and help you avoid common mistakes.

## Selection Criteria

Before opening catalogs and comparing models, nail down the key parameters of your project.

### 1. Grow Box Area

Area is the first and foremost parameter that determines the required wattage. Ratios for quality LED fixtures:

- **40x40 cm** — 50–80 W
- **60x60 cm** — 100–150 W
- **80x80 cm** — 200–280 W
- **100x100 cm** — 300–480 W
- **120x120 cm** — 450–650 W

For HPS, approximately 1.5–2 times more wattage is needed to achieve equivalent PPFD.

### 2. Budget

Budget includes not just the cost of the lamp but also associated expenses:

- **Lamp / fixture** — the main expense
- **Ballast** — for HPS/MH, $20 to $100+
- **Reflector** — for HPS/MH, $10 to $50
- **CoolTube** — optional for HPS, from $20
- **Ventilation** — a more powerful exhaust fan for HPS will cost more
- **Electricity** — monthly expenses that over a year can exceed the lamp's purchase price

| Budget | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Under $30 | 100–150 W CFL or a budget LED from a marketplace (with caution) |
| $30–80 | 250–400 W HPS + electronic ballast + reflector |
| $80–150 | 120–240 W LED Quantum Board (DIY or ready-made) |
| $150–300 | Quality 240–480 W LED from reputable manufacturers |
| Over $300 | Professional LED systems with full spectrum control |

### 3. Heat Output

Heat output is a critical factor, especially in small boxes and hot climates.

- **400 W HPS** dissipates approximately 300 W of heat — requires powerful ventilation
- **200 W LED** dissipates approximately 100–120 W of heat — significantly less
- **150 W CFL** dissipates approximately 100 W of heat — acceptable for small boxes

If you cannot set up powerful exhaust ventilation, or the box is in a hot room, choose LED.

### 4. Spectrum

A lamp's spectrum determines which growth stages it will be effective for:

- **6500 K (cool)** — vegetation
- **2700 K (warm)** — flowering
- **3000–3500 K (neutral)** — universal
- **Full spectrum LED** — from vegetation through flowering
- **HPS** — primarily flowering, but also works during vegetation

If you plan to use a single lamp for the entire cycle, choose a full-spectrum LED (3000–3500 K with added 660 nm red).

### 5. Box Height

Box height limits your lamp choices:

- **Under 100 cm** — CFL or compact LED only. HPS won't fit with a safe distance.
- **100–140 cm** — compact LED, CFL, 150–250 W HPS (with limitations)
- **140–180 cm** — any lamp type with some limitations for high-wattage HPS
- **Over 180 cm** — any lamp type without restrictions

Keep in mind that you need to subtract from the box height: pot height (15–25 cm), distance from lamp to ceiling (5–10 cm), and minimum distance from lamp to plants (20–60 cm depending on type).

## Step-by-Step Selection Process

### Step 1: Determine Area and Height

Measure (or determine when purchasing) the internal dimensions of your box in centimeters.

### Step 2: Set Your Budget

Determine the maximum amount you are willing to spend on lighting (including all components). Don't forget to budget for electricity costs.

### Step 3: Eliminate Unsuitable Types

- Box shorter than 120 cm? Rule out HPS.
- Budget under $80? Rule out quality LED.
- Unable to set up powerful exhaust? Rule out HPS/MH.
- Area larger than 1 m²? Rule out CFL as the primary source.

### Step 4: Choose the Lamp Type

Based on the remaining options, choose a type:

- **LED Quantum Board** — the best choice in most cases
- **HPS** — if budget is limited and the box is tall enough
- **CFL** — only for micro grows or as a temporary solution
- **CMH** — if you want an alternative to LED with an excellent spectrum

### Step 5: Calculate Wattage

Using the tables from the "Lighting Calculations" article, determine the required wattage for your area.

### Step 6: Select a Specific Model

When choosing, pay attention to the parameters described below.

## What to Look for When Buying LED

### Diodes

The key component. Best options:

- **Samsung LM301B** — the proven standard, efficiency up to 2.7 umol/J
- **Samsung LM301H** — an improved version of the LM301B
- **Osram** — some series are comparable to Samsung
- **Bridgelux** — good value for money
- **Cree** — quality, but not always more efficient than Samsung

Avoid fixtures with unlisted or unknown diodes. If the seller cannot name the diode brand, that is a red flag.

### Driver

The driver is the second most important component:

- **MeanWell** — the gold standard. HLG, ELG, XLG series are excellent choices.
- **Inventronics** — a quality alternative
- **Sosen** — an acceptable option
- **No-name drivers** — risk of overheating, instability, and failure

A dimmable driver (with a B or AB suffix in MeanWell nomenclature) is strongly recommended.

### Build Quality

- **Heat sink** — aluminum of sufficient thickness for heat dissipation
- **Wires and connections** — solder quality, no exposed contacts
- **Hangers** — reliable mounting hardware
- **Moisture protection** — not critical for a box but desirable (IP54+)

## What to Check When Buying HPS

- **Lamp** — Philips, Osram, Sylvania are proven brands. GE is acceptable.
- **Ballast** — electronic is preferable to magnetic. Brands: Philips, GIB Lighting, Maxibright.
- **Reflector** — wing-type (Adjust-A-Wings, Gavita) provides the best distribution.
- **Socket** — ceramic E40 with spring-loaded contact.
- **Wattage match** — the ballast must match the lamp's wattage.

## What to Avoid

### Red Flags When Choosing LED

- **Inflated claimed wattage** — "1000W LED" with actual consumption of 120 W
- **No information about diodes and driver**
- **Suspiciously low price** — a quality LED cannot cost $20 for 200 W
- **Purple glow (blurple)** — outdated technology, unless it is a specialized fixture
- **Promises of "equivalent to 1000 W HPS"** — marketing gimmicks
- **Built-in fans in LED panels** — often noisy and unreliable, a sign of poor heat dissipation

### Red Flags When Choosing HPS

- **Very cheap lamps from unknown brands** — may have short lifespans and unstable spectra
- **Magnetic ballasts without a built-in ignitor** — require a separate pulse ignition device
- **Open reflectors without ventilation** — all heat goes into the box

## Recommendations by Use Case

### First Grow, Minimal Budget

**250 W HPS** with an electronic ballast and wing reflector. A proven combination that delivers predictable results. Be prepared for significant heat output.

### First Grow, Moderate Budget

**120–150 W LED Quantum Board** for a 60x60 cm box or **240 W** for an 80x80 cm box. Easy to use, minimal configuration, excellent efficiency.

### Experienced Grower, Maximum Results

**400–600 W LED bars** with dimming for a 120x120 cm box. Even coverage, fine-tuned intensity control, long service life.

### Mother Plants / Clones

**T5 fluorescent tubes** or a **low-power 50–80 W LED**. High intensity is not needed; what matters is uniformity and economy.

## DIY vs. Off-the-Shelf Solutions

### DIY LED Assembly

**Pros:** 30–50% cost savings, choice of components, the satisfaction of building it yourself, customization options.

**Cons:** requires basic soldering or electrical skills, risk of errors, no warranty, assembly time.

**What you need:** diode modules or strips, MeanWell driver, aluminum heat sink, wires, hangers.

### Off-the-Shelf Solutions

**Pros:** manufacturer warranty, proven designs, time savings, technical support.

**Cons:** higher cost, limited configuration choices.

For beginners, a ready-made fixture from a reputable manufacturer is recommended. DIY is for those with electrical experience who want to save money.

## Final Checklist

Before purchasing, make sure you have answers to all of these questions:

- What is the box area?
- What is the box height?
- What is your budget (lamp + components + electricity)?
- Can you set up powerful ventilation?
- Do you plan to use one lamp for all stages or switch between lamps?
- What lamp type did you choose and why?
- What exact model / components?
- Have you checked reviews from real growers?

By answering these questions, you will minimize the chance of a bad purchase and ensure your plants receive optimal lighting from day one.
