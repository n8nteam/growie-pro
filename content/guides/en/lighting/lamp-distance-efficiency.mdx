# Lamp Efficiency at Different Distances

The distance from the lamp to the plant canopy is one of the most critical parameters that directly affects light intensity, temperature, and growing results. Even the most powerful lamp will be useless if hung too high. Conversely, placing it too close can cause light burn and heat stress.

## The Inverse Square Law

Light intensity from a point source decreases inversely proportional to the square of the distance. This is a fundamental law of physics that every grower needs to understand.

### Formula

**I₂ = I₁ x (d₁ / d₂)²**

Where:
- **I₁** — intensity at distance d₁
- **I₂** — intensity at distance d₂
- **d₁** and **d₂** — distances from the source

### Practical Implications

If the PPFD at 30 cm from the lamp is 800 umol/s/m², then:
- At 60 cm: 800 x (30/60)² = 800 x 0.25 = **200 umol/s/m²**
- At 45 cm: 800 x (30/45)² = 800 x 0.44 = **355 umol/s/m²**
- At 90 cm: 800 x (30/90)² = 800 x 0.11 = **89 umol/s/m²**

Doubling the distance reduces intensity by a factor of 4. This explains why every centimeter matters.

**Important caveat:** The inverse square law strictly applies only to point light sources. Large panels (LED Quantum Boards, LED bar arrays) behave differently — at close range they act more like a flat source, and the drop in intensity is less severe. However, at distances exceeding the panel's size, the law begins to apply.

## How Distance Affects Plants

### Too Close — Signs of Light Stress

- **Bleaching of upper leaves** — leaves turn pale, yellow, or white (light burn)
- **Leaves curling upward** — the "taco effect," where leaves fold in half
- **Foxtailing** on buds — unnatural elongation of calyxes
- **Stunted top growth** while lower parts grow normally
- **Thermal stress** — especially with HPS and MH lamps, which emit substantial infrared heat

### Too Far — Signs of Insufficient Light

- **Elongated internodes** — the plant stretches toward the light, becoming tall and thin
- **Thin, weak stems**
- **Pale, small leaves**
- **Slow growth**
- **Reduced yield** — loose, underdeveloped buds
- **Lower leaves yellowing and dropping** due to light deprivation

## Optimal Distances for Different Lamp Types

### HPS

HPS is a powerful point source with high heat output. Distance is determined by both light intensity and temperature.

| Wattage | Vegetation | Flowering | Minimum Safe Distance |
|---|---|---|---|
| 150 W | 30–40 cm | 20–30 cm | 15 cm |
| 250 W | 35–50 cm | 25–35 cm | 20 cm |
| 400 W | 40–60 cm | 30–45 cm | 25 cm |
| 600 W | 45–70 cm | 35–55 cm | 30 cm |
| 1000 W | 60–90 cm | 45–65 cm | 40 cm |

**Hand test:** Place the back of your hand at canopy level for 30 seconds. If it feels too hot, raise the lamp.

### MH (Metal Halide)

MH lamps produce somewhat more heat than HPS of equivalent wattage and emit slightly more UV radiation.

| Wattage | Recommended Distance |
|---|---|
| 250 W | 30–50 cm |
| 400 W | 40–60 cm |
| 600 W | 50–75 cm |

### CFL

Compact fluorescent lamps have low intensity, so they need to be placed as close to the plants as possible.

| Wattage | Recommended Distance |
|---|---|
| 23–42 W | 5–15 cm |
| 65–105 W | 10–20 cm |
| 150–250 W | 15–30 cm |

CFLs practically cannot burn plants due to their low heat output. The main rule is to keep them as close as possible.

### LED Fixtures

The distance for LEDs depends on wattage, diode type, and whether lenses are used. Fixtures with a narrow beam angle (lensed) create a more concentrated beam and require greater distance.

| Wattage (actual) | Vegetation | Flowering |
|---|---|---|
| 50–100 W | 30–45 cm | 20–35 cm |
| 100–200 W | 35–55 cm | 25–45 cm |
| 200–400 W | 40–65 cm | 30–50 cm |
| 400–600 W | 50–75 cm | 35–60 cm |

**For Quantum Boards:** The large panel surface area provides more uniform distribution. Typical distance is 30–50 cm during flowering, 40–60 cm during vegetation.

**For lensed LEDs:** A 60° or 90° beam angle creates a more focused beam. Increase the distance by 10–15 cm compared to lensless fixtures.

## How to Properly Measure Distance

Distance is measured from the bottom edge of the lamp (or the light-emitting surface) to the top of the tallest plant.

### Measurement Tools

- **Lux meter** — an affordable tool for relative measurements. Smartphone lux meter apps give very rough readings but can serve as a guide.
- **PAR meter (quantum sensor)** — a professional instrument for measuring PPFD. Expensive but delivers accurate data.
- **Hand test** — subjective but useful for lamps with high heat output.

### Measurement Method

1. Fix the lamp at a specific height
2. Measure illuminance at several points: center, middle of each side, corners
3. Record all values
4. Calculate the average and non-uniformity ratio (maximum to minimum)
5. If the non-uniformity exceeds 2:1, raise the lamp higher or add supplemental side lighting

## Reflector Impact on Distance

Reflector quality significantly affects the optimal distance:

- **A good reflector** (wing-type for HPS, CoolTube) — allows hanging the lamp closer by directing light downward and dissipating heat
- **CoolTube** (lamp in a glass tube with forced ventilation) — reduces temperature at canopy level and allows reducing distance by 10–20 cm
- **Bare lamp without a reflector** — a significant portion of light is lost; must be hung lower, but heat is higher

## Dynamic Distance Management

The distance from lamp to plants is not a static value. It needs to be adjusted as the plants grow.

### Recommended Approach

1. **Seedlings/clones** — maximum distance, minimum intensity. For LED — 60–80 cm or use a dimmer to reduce power to 25–50%.
2. **Early vegetation** — gradually decrease the distance or increase power every 3–5 days, observing plant response.
3. **Late vegetation** — standard working distance for vegetation.
4. **Stretch (early flowering)** — plants grow rapidly. Raise the lamp to maintain distance. Keep in mind the plant may double in height during the first 2–3 weeks of flowering.
5. **Mid to late flowering** — minimum working distance for maximum intensity.

### Using a Dimmer

Modern LED fixtures with dimmable drivers allow controlling intensity without changing height. This is more convenient and enables more precise adjustments:

- Seedlings: 25–40% power
- Vegetation: 50–75% power
- Flowering: 75–100% power

## Common Mistakes

- **Not adjusting distance as plants grow** — the plant stretches into the lamp and gets burned
- **Relying solely on "watt equivalent"** — different lamps at the same wattage produce vastly different intensities
- **Ignoring non-uniformity** — center plants get burned while edge plants stretch
- **Not accounting for the stretch** — during early flowering, plants can double in height within 2 weeks
- **Using a smartphone as a lux meter for precise decisions** — the margin of error can be 30–50%

Regularly inspect the tops of your plants, measure temperature at canopy level, and adjust lamp height promptly.
