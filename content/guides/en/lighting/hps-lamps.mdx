# High Pressure Sodium — HPS

High Pressure Sodium (HPS) lamps have remained the gold standard in indoor gardening for decades. Despite the rise of LEDs, HPS lamps are still widely used thanks to their proven effectiveness, affordability, and powerful light output. In this article, we'll cover everything you need to know about sodium lamps for grow boxes.

## How They Work

A high pressure sodium lamp is a gas-discharge light source. Inside the outer bulb made of heat-resistant glass sits a burner — a small tube made of polycrystalline aluminum oxide (leucosapphire). The burner is filled with a mixture of sodium, mercury, and xenon.

When a high-voltage pulse from the ignitor is applied, an arc discharge forms inside the burner. The sodium heats up and transitions to a gaseous state, emitting its characteristic yellow-orange light. The working pressure inside the burner reaches 100 kPa, and the temperature reaches 1200–1400 K.

For stable operation, the lamp requires a ballast — a device that limits the current through the lamp and ensures a stable burning mode.

## Types of HPS Lamps

### Standard Tubular HPS

The classic sodium lamp with a transparent cylindrical outer bulb. Light is emitted in all directions, so a quality reflector is essential for effective use in a grow box. The bulb is made of heat-resistant glass and transmits minimal ultraviolet.

### Reflector HPS

An improved version of the standard HPS with a built-in mirror reflector inside the bulb. The reflective coating is applied to the inner surface of the upper portion of the bulb, directing light downward without an external reflector. Reflector HPS lamps are more convenient to install but more expensive and less flexible in terms of light distribution.

### Diffused HPS

A lamp with a frosted bulb that diffuses light. Rarely used for grow boxes due to significant light output losses from diffusion.

## Spectral Characteristics

The HPS spectrum is concentrated primarily in the yellow-orange region (580–620 nm). This isn't an ideal spectrum for a full growth cycle, but it is highly effective for the flowering and fruiting stage, when plants especially need red and far-red light.

Typical HPS spectrum distribution:

- Blue region (400–500 nm) — approximately 5–8% of emission
- Green region (500–580 nm) — approximately 20–25%
- Yellow-orange region (580–620 nm) — approximately 45–50%
- Red region (620–700 nm) — approximately 20–25%
- Far-red region (700–780 nm) — approximately 3–5%

The lack of blue spectrum can cause plants to stretch during the vegetative stage. That's why experienced growers combine HPS with MH or use HPS primarily during flowering.

## Wattages and Their Applications

| Wattage | Light Output | Coverage Area | Application |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| 150 W | 15,000 lm | 40x40 cm | Micro grow, supplemental lighting |
| 250 W | 28,000 lm | 60x60 cm | Small grow box |
| 400 W | 48,000 lm | 80x80 cm | Medium grow box |
| 600 W | 90,000 lm | 100x100 cm | Standard grow tent |
| 1000 W | 130,000 lm | 120x120 cm | Large areas (rarely used as a hobby) |

The 600 W lamp is considered the most efficient in terms of lumens per watt — it produces up to 150 lm/W, whereas the 400 W produces about 120 lm/W. This is why the 600 W HPS is the most popular choice.

## Lifespan and Degradation

The manufacturer-rated lifespan of HPS lamps is 12,000–24,000 hours depending on the model and manufacturer. However, for growing, what matters is not just the burning time, but the period during which sufficient light output is maintained.

In practice, it's recommended to replace the lamp every 12–18 months of active use (on a 12/12 or 18/6 light schedule). Toward the end of its life, the lamp loses 20–30% of its initial light output, and the spectrum shifts toward yellow, reducing effectiveness for plants.

Signs of degradation:

- Noticeable dimming
- Slow startup (more than 5–7 minutes to reach operating mode)
- Cyclic on-off behavior (flickering)
- Change in light color (more yellow or pinkish tint)

## Electronic Ballast and Ignitor: Connection

### Ignitor

The ignitor generates high-voltage pulses (2–5 kV) to strike the lamp. They come in two-pin and three-pin varieties. Three-pin models are preferred because they stop sending pulses after the lamp strikes, which extends the lamp's lifespan.

### Magnetic Ballast (Choke)

The classic ballast option — a choke (inductive resistance). Cheap and reliable but heavy, generates heat, hums, and reduces system efficiency by 10–15% due to winding losses.

### Electronic Ballast

A modern device that combines the functions of an ignitor and ballast in one unit. Advantages of electronic ballasts:

- 10–15% higher efficiency compared to magnetic ballasts
- Lightweight and compact
- No humming or vibration
- Current stabilization, extending lamp lifespan
- Dimming capability (power adjustment) on some models
- Soft start, reducing stress on the lamp

Popular electronic ballasts: Lumatek, Maxibright, ETI, Solis Tek. When choosing an electronic ballast, make sure its wattage matches the lamp wattage.

## Comparison with Other Lamp Types

| Parameter | HPS 600 W | LED 600 W | MH 600 W | CFL (equivalent) |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| Light output | 90,000 lm | 60,000–90,000 lm | 55,000 lm | 40,000 lm |
| Efficiency | 150 lm/W | 170–220 lm/W | 90 lm/W | 60–80 lm/W |
| PAR efficiency | 1.7 umol/J | 2.2–2.8 umol/J | 1.2 umol/J | 0.8–1.2 umol/J |
| Heat output | High | Medium | High | Low |
| Lifespan | 12,000–24,000 h | 50,000+ h | 10,000–15,000 h | 8,000–15,000 h |
| Initial cost | Low | High | Medium | Low |

## Advantages of HPS

- Technology proven over decades with predictable results
- High light output at an affordable price
- Deep light penetration into the plant canopy
- Excellent results during flowering thanks to the dominant red-orange spectrum
- Easy lamp replacement (no need to replace the entire system)
- Huge selection of lamps and equipment on the market
- Heat output can be beneficial in cold environments

## Disadvantages of HPS

- High heat output — requires powerful ventilation
- Requires an electronic ballast/ignitor and quality reflector
- Suboptimal spectrum for the vegetative stage
- Contains mercury — requires careful disposal
- Degrades over time — requires regular replacement
- Higher energy consumption than modern LEDs
- Fire hazard if improperly installed (bulb temperature up to 400°C)

## Recommendations for Use in a Grow Box

For successful use of HPS in a grow box, follow these guidelines:

- Distance from lamp to plant tops: 30–40 cm for 250 W, 40–60 cm for 400 W, 50–70 cm for 600 W. Check with the back of your hand — if it feels hot, it's too hot for the plants too.
- Always use a quality reflector. A good reflector increases efficiency by 30–40%.
- Ensure exhaust ventilation. For a 400 W HPS, the minimum inline fan should be 150 mm; for 600 W — 200 mm.
- Use a cool tube to vent hot air away from the lamp through a separate circuit.
- Hang the lamp on adjustable hangers so you can change the height as plants grow.
- Connect the lamp through a timer for automatic light schedule control.
- Don't touch the bulb with bare hands — fingerprints on the glass cause localized overheating and can lead to bulb failure.

HPS remains an excellent choice for growers who want a high yield with moderate initial investment. The key is ensuring adequate ventilation and properly matching the wattage to the size of the growing space.
