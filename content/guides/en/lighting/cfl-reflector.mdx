# Reflector for CFL Lamps

A compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) emits light in all directions -- up, down, and sideways. Without a reflector, 40-50% of the light goes up to the box ceiling, bounces off the walls with losses, and only partially returns to the plants. A simple reflector increases usable light by 30-40% -- for free, without swapping the lamp.

## Why a CFL Needs a Reflector

CFLs (spiral and U-shaped) have a luminous surface distributed across the entire tube. Unlike LED bulbs, which direct light into one hemisphere, a CFL emits at 360 degrees. This means that when the lamp is hung above the plants:

- Roughly 40% of light goes upward and up-sideways
- 30% goes horizontally
- Only 30% goes directly downward toward the plants

A reflector intercepts the upward light and redirects it to the growing zone.

### Calculating the Effect

Suppose a CFL produces 5,000 lumens. Without a reflector, plants receive about 1,500-2,000 lm directly, plus 1,000-1,500 lm from wall reflections (with good reflective walls). Total: 2,500-3,500 lm of useful light.

With a reflector that reflects 85% of the upward flux: plants receive 1,500-2,000 lm directly + 1,700 lm from the reflector + 500-800 lm from walls. Total: 3,700-4,500 lm of useful light.

Gain: 30-40% -- a noticeable difference visible in the growth rate of the plants.

## Simple Options from Household Materials

### Tin Can Reflector

The most accessible option. Suitable for E27 CFLs up to 55W.

Materials:

- Tin can, 10-15 cm diameter
- Metal shears
- E27 socket

How to make it:

1. Cut out the bottom of the can
2. Cut the can lengthwise on one side
3. Flatten it into a sheet and straighten
4. Shape into a cone -- wide end down, narrow end up
5. Make a hole in the narrow end for the socket
6. Mount the socket
7. To improve reflectance, line the inner surface with mirror-finish self-adhesive film or foil on double-sided tape

Reflectance of tin is about 50-60%. With foil lining, up to 75-80%.

### CD/DVD Disc Reflector

An unconventional but functional option for small E27 lamps (up to 30W).

Materials:

- One CD or DVD disc
- E27 socket with a ring

How to make it:

1. Widen the center hole of the disc to socket diameter (using a drill or file)
2. Slide the disc onto the socket and secure with the socket ring
3. Position the disc above the lamp with the shiny side facing down

The disc reflects upward-going light back toward the plants. The reflective area is small, so the effect is modest -- about 10-15% gain. Works as a temporary solution.

### Aluminum Foil Reflector

Materials:

- Household aluminum foil
- Cardboard (as a form base)
- Glue or tape

How to make it:

1. Cut a circle from cardboard, 30-40 cm diameter
2. Cut a center hole for the socket
3. Make a radial cut and form a cone
4. Line the inner surface with foil, minimizing wrinkles
5. Attach to the socket

Important: foil on cardboard is not suitable for high-wattage CFLs (100W+) -- the cardboard may overheat. Use only with lamps up to 50-60W.

## Effective Options

### Aluminum Cone

The most effective DIY reflector for CFLs. Made from 0.3-0.5 mm aluminum sheet.

Materials:

- Aluminum sheet, 400x400 mm (for CFLs up to 85W) or 500x500 mm (for CFLs 105-200W)
- Rivets or M3 screws
- E27 or E40 socket

How to make it:

1. Mark a circle of the needed diameter on the sheet
2. Cut it out with metal shears
3. Cut a center hole, 40-45 mm diameter (for the socket)
4. Make one radial cut from center to edge
5. Overlap the cut edges by 20-30 mm to form a cone with a 100-120 degree opening angle
6. Secure the overlap with rivets (2-3 pieces)
7. File the edges smooth
8. Install the socket in the center hole

The cone angle affects the light footprint shape:

| Opening Angle | Footprint Width | Center Intensity |
|---|---|---|
| 90 degrees | Narrow | High |
| 110 degrees | Medium | Medium |
| 130 degrees | Wide | Low |

For a 40x40 cm box, 100-110 degrees is optimal. For 60x60 cm, go with 120-130 degrees.

### Corrugated Aluminum Reflector

An improved version of the cone: after forming the cone, create small longitudinal corrugations (ridges) on the inner surface at 5-10 mm intervals. This converts specular reflection into diffuse reflection, eliminating hot spots and improving uniformity.

To create the corrugations, roll the aluminum between two ribbed surfaces, or press in the pattern with a blunt tool (such as the back of a knife) along a straightedge.

## Achieving the 30-40% Efficiency Gain

To get the maximum benefit from a reflector, follow these guidelines:

### Reflector Size

The reflector diameter should be at least 2.5-3 times the CFL tube diameter. A small reflector intercepts only part of the upward light.

### Lamp Position

The CFL tube should extend beyond the lower edge of the reflector by 50-70% of its length. If the lamp is recessed inside the reflector, light bounces back and forth between the reflector and the tube, heating the lamp and reducing efficiency.

### Surface Cleanliness

Dust, residue, and oxidation lower reflectance. Wipe the reflector with a soft cloth every 2-4 weeks.

### Distance to Plants

With a reflector you can hang the lamp a bit higher -- the footprint becomes wider. Without a reflector, an 85W CFL is optimal at 10-15 cm from the canopy. With a reflector -- 15-25 cm, while the coverage area increases.

## How to Mount the Reflector

### On the Socket

If the socket has a threaded ring (most E27 and E40 do), the reflector with a center hole slips over the socket and is secured by the ring. This is the simplest and most reliable method.

### On a Separate Suspension

The reflector is hung from cables or chains independently of the lamp. This allows the reflector and lamp heights to be adjusted independently. Suitable for multi-lamp setups.

### On a Bracket

An aluminum angle or steel strip is fastened to the box ceiling, and the reflector is attached to the bracket. Convenient when a fixed position is needed.

## One Large Reflector or Several Small Ones?

If there are multiple CFLs in the box, each should have its own reflector. A single large shared reflector over several lamps works worse because the reflection geometry is compromised.

The exception is a flat multi-lamp fixture: a horizontal panel with several sockets and a single flat reflective surface above. This design works but is less efficient than individual cones.

## Conclusion

A CFL reflector is minimal cost with tangible results. Even the simplest "cap" from household materials noticeably increases the amount of light reaching the plants. An aluminum cone offers the best effort-to-effect ratio. Building one takes 20-30 minutes and very little money in materials.
