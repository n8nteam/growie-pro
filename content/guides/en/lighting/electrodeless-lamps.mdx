# Electrodeless — Sulfur Plasma and Induction

In the world of light sources, there are technologies that most growers will never encounter in everyday practice, yet they deserve attention for their unique characteristics. Sulfur plasma and induction lamps are electrodeless light sources representing the pinnacle of engineering in gas-discharge lighting.

## Sulfur Plasma Lamp

### How It Works

The sulfur plasma lamp is one of the most unusual light sources ever created. Structurally, it consists of a quartz bulb about the size of a golf ball, filled with argon and a small amount of sulfur (approximately 30 mg). The bulb rotates inside a metal mesh resonator fed by microwave radiation from a magnetron (the same type used in microwave ovens).

The microwave radiation (2.45 GHz frequency) heats the gas inside the bulb, ionizing it. Plasma forms — a high-temperature ionized gas. Sulfur molecules in the plasma (S2) emit intense light. The rotation of the bulb is necessary for even temperature distribution and to prevent overheating.

### A Spectrum Close to Sunlight

The main virtue of the sulfur lamp is its spectrum. Unlike most artificial light sources, the sulfur lamp emits a virtually continuous spectrum remarkably close to that of the sun:

- Color temperature: 5700–6000 K (almost identical to the Sun's 5778 K)
- CRI (Color Rendering Index): 79–86
- Broad continuous spectrum from 350 to 850 nm
- Mercury-free — environmentally safe
- Virtually no UV-C radiation (dangerous to health)
- Minimal infrared radiation compared to incandescent lamps

For plants, this spectrum is ideal — it contains all necessary wavelengths in proportions close to natural sunlight. Photosynthesis, photomorphogenesis, phototropism — all processes receive an optimal light signal.

### Power and Specifications

- Lamp power: 1000–1400 W
- Light output: 130,000–180,000 lm
- Efficiency: 80–130 lm/W (depends on model and operating mode)
- Lifespan: 20,000–60,000 hours (no electrodes — nothing to wear out)
- Instant re-strike
- Smooth dimming capability

### History and Manufacturers

The technology was developed in the early 1990s by Fusion Lighting (USA). The first public demonstration took place in 1994 and caused a sensation — a fist-sized lamp illuminated like a floodlight. Later, the technology was developed by LG Electronics (LG Plasma series), Topanga Technologies, and Hive Lighting.

LG PSH (Plasma Sulfur Hive) lamps rated at 625–1000 W were once positioned as ideal for greenhouses and vertical farms. However, the technology never achieved widespread adoption.

### Real-World Applicability for Grow Boxes

The sulfur lamp is an engineering marvel that is, unfortunately, virtually unusable for home grow boxes:

- Enormous power — minimum 625 W, excessive for small areas
- Requires a magnetron and rotation system — complex construction
- High level of electromagnetic radiation (microwave) — requires shielding
- Noise from the cooling and rotation systems
- Cost — thousands of dollars per system
- Nearly impossible to purchase — mass production has been discontinued or is extremely limited
- Parts and service — finding a replacement magnetron or bulb becomes a quest

Sulfur lamps are theoretically interesting for commercial greenhouses, but in practice, LEDs have proven to be a more practical and accessible alternative.

## Induction Lamp

### How It Works

An induction (electrodeless) lamp is an improved fluorescent lamp with no electrodes inside the bulb. Gas excitation is achieved through electromagnetic induction.

The design consists of three main elements:

- A bulb with a phosphor coating, filled with inert gas and mercury vapor (same as a standard fluorescent lamp)
- An induction coil (ferrite core with winding), positioned inside or around the bulb
- A high-frequency generator (ballast), powering the coil at 2.65 MHz or 250 kHz

The high-frequency current in the coil creates an alternating magnetic field, which induces a ring electric current in the gas inside the bulb. This current excites mercury atoms, which emit UV light that is converted to visible light by the phosphor.

In essence, it's the same fluorescent lamp, but with an electromagnetic field instead of electrodes. The absence of electrodes eliminates the main cause of failure in standard fluorescent lamps — the degradation of the emissive coating.

### Longevity and Low Degradation

The absence of electrodes provides outstanding longevity:

- Lifespan: 60,000–100,000 hours (up to 11 years of continuous operation)
- Light output degradation: less than 15% over 60,000 hours
- On-off cycling does not affect lifespan
- Instant re-strike (unlike HPS and MH)

For comparison: a standard T5 fluorescent lasts 15,000–20,000 hours, HPS — 12,000–24,000 hours.

### Specifications for Plant Growing

- Wattages: 40–400 W
- Efficiency: 60–90 lm/W
- Color temperatures: 2700K, 3500K, 4100K, 5000K, 6500K
- CRI: 80–85
- Spectrum similar to fluorescent lamps — depends on the phosphor
- Low heat output
- Operates in a wide temperature range (-40 to +50°C)
- Dimming from 30% to 100%

Some manufacturers (for example, Inda-Gro) produced induction lamps specifically designed for horticulture, with an optimized phosphor (including red phosphors to stimulate flowering).

### Induction Lamp Manufacturers

- Philips QL — one of the first commercially successful induction systems (since 1991)
- Osram Endura — series for commercial lighting
- GE Genura — compact induction lamp with reflector
- Inda-Gro (USA) — specialized models for horticulture (420W Induction Grow Light)
- Numerous Chinese manufacturers (Shanghai Hongyuan, Yunnan Green)

### Applicability for Grow Boxes

Induction lamps for grow boxes are a niche and debatable solution:

Potential advantages:

- Record-breaking longevity — no need to replace lamps for years
- Very stable spectrum throughout the entire lifespan
- Low heat output
- Instant start and restart

Significant disadvantages:

- Efficiency (60–90 lm/W) is significantly lower than LED and HPS
- High system cost (ballast + lamp)
- Limited model selection on the market
- Many manufacturers have discontinued production or left the market
- PAR efficiency (umol/J) is 2–3 times lower than modern LEDs
- Electromagnetic interference from the high-frequency generator

## Should You Consider Electrodeless Lamps

At the present time, electrodeless lamps are more of academic interest than a practical solution for home grow boxes. The sulfur lamp is an engineering masterpiece with an amazing spectrum, but its power, cost, and design complexity make it unusable for hobby growing. The induction lamp is more practical but falls short of LEDs on all key parameters at a significantly higher cost.

If you come across an induction or sulfur lamp on the secondhand market at an attractive price, it could make for an interesting experiment. But actively seeking out and purchasing electrodeless lamps for a grow box in the era of affordable and efficient LED quantum boards makes no practical sense.

Nevertheless, knowledge of these technologies broadens your understanding of how far engineering has progressed in creating artificial light sources, and what remarkable physical principles can underpin plant lighting.
