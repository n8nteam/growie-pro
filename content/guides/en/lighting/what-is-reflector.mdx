# What Is a Reflector

A reflector is a device installed above (or around) a lamp to redirect the light output downward toward the plants. Without a reflector, a significant portion of the light escapes upward and sideways, never reaching the leaves. In a grow box where every lumen counts, a proper reflector can increase the amount of useful light by 30-60% without replacing the lamp.

## Why You Need a Reflector

Most high-intensity discharge lamps (HPS, MH) and CFLs emit light in all directions -- a full 360 degrees. If the lamp is simply hanging inside the box, roughly half of the photons fly upward and sideways, bounce off the walls with losses, and only partially reach the plants. A reflector solves this problem by collecting and directing light into the target zone.

Key functions of a reflector:

- Increasing the share of light that reaches the plants
- Shaping a uniform light footprint
- Reducing hot spots directly under the lamp
- Minimizing losses from multiple reflections off the box walls

## Reflector Materials

### Mirror-Finish Aluminum

Polished aluminum sheet with a reflectance of 85-95%. This is the most common material in commercial reflectors. Available in anodized (more durable) and non-anodized varieties. Brands like Alanod Miro (Germany) achieve up to 95% reflectance in the visible spectrum.

### Matte (Diffuse) Aluminum

A micro-textured surface that scatters reflected light. Reflectance is slightly lower at 80-90%, but the light footprint is more uniform, without harsh shadows or bright spots. Well suited for shorter grow boxes.

### White Paint and Plastic

A matte white surface reflects 75-85% of light. Used in budget DIY builds. The main drawback is that it yellows over time from the heat of nearby hot lamps. Suitable for CFLs and LEDs, but not for 400W+ HPS lamps.

### Foil and Reflective Insulation

Household aluminum foil has a reflectance of about 80%, but it wrinkles and creates uneven reflections with hot spots. Foil-backed polyethylene insulation is more convenient -- it stays flat and is easy to attach -- but its reflective properties are inferior to mirror-finish aluminum.

| Material | Reflectance | Reflection Type | Heat Resistance |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mirror-finish aluminum (Miro) | 90-95% | Specular | High |
| Matte aluminum | 80-90% | Diffuse | High |
| White paint (titanium white) | 75-85% | Diffuse | Medium |
| Aluminum foil | ~80% | Specular (uneven) | Medium |
| Reflective insulation | 70-80% | Specular | Low |

## Reflector Shapes

### Parabolic Reflector

The parabolic shape is mathematically ideal for a light source positioned at the focal point: all reflected rays travel straight down in parallel. In practice, a lamp is not a point source, but a parabolic reflector still produces the narrowest and most powerful light beam. Best suited for tall boxes and long lamp-to-canopy distances.

### Wing Reflector

Two aluminum "wings" extending outward from the lamp. A simple design with a wide spread angle. Ideal for long rectangular boxes and SCROG setups. It does not provide deep penetration but covers a large area.

### Open-Ended Reflector

A reflector without side walls -- light spreads freely to the sides. Good ventilation prevents the lamp from overheating. The downside is that some light is still lost.

### Air-Cooled Reflector

A reflector with a glass bottom panel and flanges for connecting ductwork. This allows the lamp to be cooled with a separate airflow. Losses through the glass are 5-10%, but you can position the lamp closer to the plants.

## Reflectance: Why It Matters

The difference between 80% and 95% reflectance seems small, but in the enclosed space of a grow box, light bounces multiple times. If a reflector reflects 95% instead of 80%, after three bounces the difference is:

- 95%^3 = 85.7% of light preserved
- 80%^3 = 51.2% of light preserved

In other words, a high-quality reflector material saves tens of percent of light energy.

## Commercial vs. DIY Reflectors

### Commercial Reflectors

Advantages of off-the-shelf solutions:

- Geometry calculated for a specific lamp wattage
- High-quality anodized aluminum
- Built-in socket and mounting hardware
- Electrical safety certification

Popular models: Adjust-A-Wings (Enforcer, Defender), Cooltube, Euro Reflector, Hammertone.

### DIY Reflectors

Advantages:

- Can be customized to fit a non-standard grow box
- Significant cost savings
- Freedom to experiment with shapes

Disadvantages:

- Requires metalworking skills
- Difficult to achieve perfect geometry
- Socket mounting must be figured out on your own

## Reflector vs. Reflective Box Walls

Beginners sometimes assume that if the box walls are covered with reflective material (Mylar, white paint, reflective insulation), a reflector is unnecessary. This is a misconception. Walls and reflectors serve different functions:

- **The reflector** redirects light traveling upward and sideways from the lamp straight down -- with minimal bounces
- **The box walls** return light that has already escaped to the sides -- these are second, third, and subsequent bounces, each losing 5-25% of energy

The ideal setup is a quality reflector plus reflective walls. The reflector does the heavy lifting; the walls pick up whatever is left.

## How to Choose a Reflector

When selecting a reflector, consider:

- **Lamp type** -- HPS/MH require heat-resistant reflectors; CFLs and LEDs work with any type
- **Box size** -- in a narrow box a parabolic reflector creates a hot spot (a wing reflector is better); in a tall, spacious box it is the other way around
- **Ventilation** -- if overheating is an issue, consider an air-cooled reflector or Cooltube
- **Budget** -- even a simple DIY reflector made from aluminum sheet is better than no reflector at all

A reflector is one of the most underrated components of a grow box. With minimal investment, it can significantly boost yields simply by making better use of the light you already have.
