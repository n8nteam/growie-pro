# The Bright and Dark Sides of CFLs

Compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) hold a special place in the home grower's toolkit. For some, they become the ideal solution; for others, a source of disappointment. It all depends on the scale of the task, expectations, and growing conditions. Let us objectively examine all the pros and cons of CFLs to help you determine whether they are right for your situation.

## CFL Advantages

### Safety

CFLs are one of the safest light sources for a grow box:

- **Low surface temperature**: the bulb heats up to 60–80°C — significantly less than HPS (300–400°C). Accidental contact is unpleasant but will not cause a serious burn
- **Minimal fire risk**: even in contact with a plant, a CFL will not cause ignition. An HPS lamp touching a leaf can set it on fire
- **No powerful ventilation required**: the heat output is not enough to critically overheat a grow box in most cases
- **Electrical safety**: the built-in ballast operates at mains voltage (220 V) with no external high-voltage components

### Ease of Connection

CFLs are the only type of grow light that requires absolutely no additional equipment:

- Screws into a standard E27 or E40 socket
- No choke needed
- No ignitor needed
- No capacitor needed
- No driver needed
- Ready to use straight out of the box

For a beginner grower with no electrical wiring experience, this is a fundamental advantage. A mistake when wiring HPS or assembling an LED fixture can lead to fire or electric shock. With CFLs, this risk is eliminated.

### Affordability

- **Price**: CFLs are significantly cheaper than an LED fixture or an HPS kit with choke and ignitor
- **Availability**: can be purchased at any hardware store or online marketplace
- **Spectrum selection**: lamps are available in 2700 K (flowering), 4000 K (universal), and 6400 K (vegetative growth) color temperatures

### Compactness

CFLs are ideal for limited space:

- Can operate 5–15 cm from the plant with no burn risk
- Suitable for micro grow boxes (computer cases, cabinets, nightstands)
- Multiple CFLs can be positioned around the plant from different sides, providing lateral lighting
- Minimum grow box height — from 40 cm (for a single short plant)

### Spectral Versatility

By combining CFLs of different color temperatures, you can create an appropriate spectrum for any growth stage:

- 2–3 lamps at 6400 K for vegetative growth
- 2–3 lamps at 2700 K for flowering
- A mix of 2700 K and 6400 K for the full cycle

## CFL Disadvantages

### Low Efficiency on Larger Areas

The main drawback of CFLs is their modest light output per watt of consumed power:

| Lamp Type | Luminous Efficacy (lm/W) | PAR Efficiency (µmol/J) |
|---|---|---|
| CFL | 50–65 lm/W | 0.8–1.2 |
| HPS 400 W | 100–120 lm/W | 1.5–1.7 |
| HPS 600 W | 140–150 lm/W | 1.7–1.9 |
| LED (quality) | 150–220 lm/W | 2.0–2.8 |

This means that to illuminate 1 m² at a level comparable to a 400 W HPS, you would need 600–800 W of CFLs. At that wattage, all CFL advantages (low temperature, low cost) are negated.

### Rapid Degradation

CFLs lose brightness significantly faster than other lamp types:

- After 3 months of active use — 10–15% luminous flux loss
- After 6 months — 20–30% loss
- After 9 months — 30–40% loss

For comparison: a quality LED loses 10% brightness over 25,000–50,000 hours; HPS — over 6,000–10,000 hours.

### Mercury Content

Each CFL contains 3–5 mg of mercury. This creates two problems:

- **Breakage hazard**: if a lamp breaks in the grow box, mercury vapor will reach the plants. The room must be ventilated, fragments collected wearing gloves, and surfaces wiped down
- **Disposal**: CFLs cannot be thrown in regular trash. They must be taken to designated recycling facilities

### Limited Maximum Wattage

The actual wattage of a single CFL is limited to approximately 100–125 W. Lamps claiming 150–200 W typically consume 80–120 W in reality. This means serious growing requires multiple lamps with multiple sockets, which complicates the setup.

### Light Distribution

CFLs emit light in all directions, and a significant portion is scattered. Unlike LED fixtures with directed output or HPS with a parabolic reflector, CFLs without a reflector lose 30–50% of their light. Using reflectors and reflective surfaces in the grow box partially addresses this issue.

### Form Factor

The spiral tube of a CFL creates self-shading. Inner coils of the spiral block light from the outer ones, reducing efficiency. Lamps in the "lotus" format (U-shaped tubes) are less affected by this issue.

## When CFLs Are the Best Choice

CFLs are optimal in the following situations:

- **First growing experience**: minimal investment, simplicity, safety. You can start with one lamp and one plant to learn the process
- **Micro grow**: growing in a computer case, nightstand, or small box. Area up to 0.3 m², 1–2 plants
- **Supplemental lighting**: CFLs work well as a secondary light source — side lighting for lower canopy levels, supplemental lighting for seedlings
- **Seedlings and clones**: rooting clones and growing seedlings do not require powerful light. A 23–55 W CFL at 6400 K is sufficient
- **Stealth grow**: silent operation (no choke), minimal heat (no powerful fan needed), compactness
- **Limited budget**: when you cannot afford LEDs and do not want to deal with HPS wiring

## When to Switch to a Different Lighting Type

Consider transitioning from CFLs to LED or HPS if:

- **Growing area exceeds 0.5 m²**: CFLs are inefficient on larger areas. A LED panel or 250 W HPS will deliver significantly better results
- **You want maximum yield**: CFLs cannot provide the light density needed for maximum harvest
- **You grow regularly**: if the grow box runs continuously, investing in LED pays for itself through efficiency and longevity
- **Electricity is expensive**: for equivalent results, LED consumes 2–3 times less energy than CFLs
- **You are unhappy with results**: if plants are stretching, yields are low, and ripening is delayed, you likely need more light

### Upgrade Paths

- **CFL to LED**: the most logical path. A 100–150 W LED panel or quantum board replaces 300+ W of CFLs with better results
- **CFL to HPS**: suitable if you can set up proper ventilation. A 250 W HPS will outperform any number of CFLs on an area up to 0.8 m²

## Comparison Table

| Criterion | CFL | HPS | LED |
|---|---|---|---|
| Entry cost | Low | Medium | High |
| Ease of connection | Maximum | Requires ballast | Requires driver |
| Safety | High | Medium | High |
| Efficiency | Low | High | Maximum |
| Heat output | Low | High | Low |
| Lifespan | 6,000–10,000 h | 10,000–20,000 h | 30,000–50,000 h |
| Yield | Modest | Excellent | Excellent |
| Suitable area | up to 0.3–0.5 m² | 0.5–2 m² | 0.3–2+ m² |

## Conclusion

CFLs are a tool with a clearly defined niche. They are excellent for getting started, learning, micro grows, and supplemental lighting. But expecting serious results from CFLs on an area larger than half a square meter is unrealistic. If you are starting with CFLs, that is a sensible choice. If you already have experience and want to scale up, it is time to move to more efficient light sources.
