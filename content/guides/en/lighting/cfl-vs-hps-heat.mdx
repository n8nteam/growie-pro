# Why CFLs Run Cooler Than HPS

One of the main arguments in favor of CFLs for small grow boxes is significantly lower heat output compared to HPS. But why does this happen? After all, both types of lamps consume electricity and convert it into light and heat. Let's examine the physics of the process, compare practical measurements, and figure out when HPS heat is a blessing and when it's a serious problem.

## The Physics of Heat Output

Any light source converts electrical energy into two main products: light (electromagnetic radiation in the visible and near-visible range) and heat. Heat is dissipated in three ways:

- Convection — heating the surrounding air from the lamp's hot surfaces
- Conduction — transferring heat through contacting materials (socket, mounting hardware)
- Radiation — infrared (IR) radiation that heats surfaces it strikes (walls, plants, pots)

The key difference between CFLs and HPS lies in the ratio of these three heat dissipation channels.

## Light Conversion Efficiency

### HPS

A 600 W High Pressure Sodium lamp has the following energy balance:

- Visible light (380–780 nm): 30–35% of consumed power
- Infrared radiation (above 780 nm): 35–40%
- Convective and conductive heat: 25–30%
- Ballast losses: 5–10%

Total: out of 600 W consumed, only 180–210 W are converted to visible light. The remaining 390–420 W become heat, with a significant portion as IR radiation.

### CFL

An 85 W compact fluorescent lamp:

- Visible light: 20–25% of consumed power
- Infrared radiation: 5–8%
- Convective and conductive heat: 60–70%
- Built-in electronic ballast losses: 5–8%

Out of 85 W consumed, about 17–21 W become visible light, 4–7 W become IR, and the rest is convective heat.

The paradox: CFLs are actually less efficient at converting electricity to light than HPS. Yet CFLs are perceived as "cooler" lamps. Why?

## HPS Infrared Radiation — The Hidden Enemy

The answer lies in infrared radiation. HPS operates at a burner temperature of 1200–1400 K. At such temperatures, a huge proportion of energy is emitted in the IR range (wavelengths 780–2500 nm and beyond).

IR radiation is fundamentally different from convective heat:

- IR rays travel at the speed of light and heat every surface they hit — leaves, stems, substrate, box walls
- IR radiation cannot be removed by ventilation — air is transparent to it
- IR heating is concentrated in the lamp's direct line of sight — disproportionately heating plant tops
- IR penetrates leaf tissue, heating it from within

This is precisely why at 30 cm from a 400 W HPS, your hand feels intense heat even though the air temperature may be acceptable.

CFLs emit virtually no IR because their tube temperature is only 60–80°C (333–353 K). At such temperatures, IR emission is negligible. All CFL heat is convective air heating, which is easily managed by ventilation.

## CFL Heat Distribution Across the Surface

CFLs have another important advantage — distributed heat dissipation. The CFL tube has a large surface area, and heat is spread across its entire length. There's no concentrated heat point (unlike the HPS burner).

Comparison of thermal flux density:

- HPS 400 W: burner approximately 21 cm long, 5 cm diameter. Radiating surface area approximately 33 cm². Thermal density: approximately 8 W/cm² at the burner surface.
- CFL 85 W: uncoiled tube length approximately 50 cm, diameter approximately 1.5 cm. Surface area approximately 235 cm². Thermal density: approximately 0.3 W/cm².

The difference in heat concentration is nearly 30 times. This explains why a CFL can be placed 5 cm from a leaf without burning it, while a 400 W HPS needs to be kept 40+ cm away.

## Practical Measurements

Typical temperature readings in a closed 60x60x160 cm grow box at a room temperature of 22°C with exhaust ventilation:

### HPS 250 W + Reflector

| Measurement Point | Temperature |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Bulb surface | 350–400°C |
| Air near reflector | 55–65°C |
| Air at canopy level (30 cm from lamp) | 35–42°C |
| Air at pot level | 27–30°C |
| Leaf surface (top) | 38–45°C |

### CFL 2x85 W (170 W total)

| Measurement Point | Temperature |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Tube surface | 60–80°C |
| Air near lamps | 30–35°C |
| Air at canopy level (10 cm from lamps) | 27–32°C |
| Air at pot level | 24–27°C |
| Leaf surface (top) | 28–33°C |

Note: at comparable total wattages (250 W HPS vs 170 W CFL), the temperature difference at plant level is 5–12°C. CFLs produce less light — but the thermal load is substantially lower.

## When HPS Heat Is an Advantage

HPS heat output isn't always a downside. In several situations, it becomes a free bonus:

### Winter Growing

If the grow box is in an unheated space (garage, balcony, attic), winter temperatures can drop to 5–15°C. Plants need 22–28°C. A 400–600 W HPS effectively heats the box interior, serving as a heater. CFLs can't do this — you'd need a separate heater, consuming additional electricity.

### Cold Irrigation Water

HPS heat warms the substrate from above, compensating for cold water. This is especially relevant in winter when tap water can be 8–12°C.

### Humidity Reduction

HPS heat lowers relative humidity, which is beneficial during flowering for mold prevention. At 28°C, air holds more moisture than at 22°C, so at the same absolute humidity, the relative humidity is lower.

## When HPS Heat Is a Problem

### Summer

In hot climates or during summer, room temperatures can reach 28–35°C. Add 200–400 W of HPS heat, and the box will hit 40–50°C — lethal for plants. Solutions: powerful ventilation, air conditioning, cool tube. All of this means additional equipment and electricity costs.

### Small Boxes

In spaces smaller than 50x50 cm, even a 150 W HPS creates excessive heat. The small air volume heats up instantly, and ventilation can't keep up. CFLs are the only reasonable choice in such conditions (aside from LED).

### Stealth Growing

Powerful exhaust ventilation for cooling an HPS creates noise and consumes energy. CFLs can get by with a quiet 120 mm computer fan.

## Energy Balance: Final Comparison

For equal coverage area (60x60 cm):

| Parameter | HPS 250 W | CFL 4x55 W (220 W) |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| Consumption from mains | 275 W (with ballast) | 220 W |
| Light (PAR) | ~100 W | ~45 W |
| IR radiation | ~100 W | ~15 W |
| Convective heat | ~75 W | ~160 W |
| Heat in ballast | ~15 W (external) | ~0 W (built-in) |
| Plant thermal stress | High without cool tube | Minimal |
| Ventilation requirements | Powerful exhaust | Moderate |

Understanding the physics of heat output helps you make an informed lighting choice. CFLs heat the air, HPS heats the air and surfaces. For small spaces and warm climates, the choice clearly favors CFLs (or LED). For larger areas and cool environments, HPS heat transforms from a drawback into a bonus.
