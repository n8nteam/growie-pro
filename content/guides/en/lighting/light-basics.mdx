# Fundamentals of Light and Lighting Technology

Light is the primary energy source for plants. Without proper lighting, it is impossible to grow a healthy, productive plant in an enclosed space. Before choosing a lamp for your grow box, you need to understand the basic concepts of lighting technology.

## What Is Light

Light is electromagnetic radiation that is visible to the human eye. From a physics standpoint, light has a dual nature — it is simultaneously a wave and a stream of particles (photons). Each photon carries a specific amount of energy determined by its wavelength.

Visible light is only a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The human eye perceives radiation with wavelengths ranging from approximately 380 to 780 nanometers (nm). However, plants use a somewhat different range, which we will discuss below.

## Wavelength and the Visible Light Spectrum

Wavelength determines the color of light we see. The visible light spectrum can be divided into the following regions:

- **Violet** — 380–450 nm
- **Blue** — 450–495 nm
- **Green** — 495–570 nm
- **Yellow** — 570–590 nm
- **Orange** — 590–620 nm
- **Red** — 620–780 nm

Beyond the visible spectrum lies ultraviolet radiation (shorter than 380 nm) and infrared radiation (longer than 780 nm). Both types play a role in plant life, but the primary energy for photosynthesis comes from the visible range.

## Color Temperature (Kelvin)

Color temperature describes the spectral composition of light emitted by a source. It is measured in Kelvin (K) and indicates the visual hue of white light.

| Color Temperature | Hue | Application |
|---|---|---|
| 2700 K | Warm yellow | Resembles incandescent light, good for flowering |
| 4000 K | Neutral white | General-purpose light |
| 5000–5500 K | Daylight white | Close to midday sunlight |
| 6500 K | Cool bluish | Optimal for vegetative growth |

For growers, color temperature serves as a simple guide when selecting lamps. Lamps rated at 6500 K contain more blue spectrum light and are suitable for the vegetative stage. Lamps rated at 2700 K are rich in red spectrum light and are better suited for flowering.

**Important:** Color temperature is a simplified characteristic. It does not provide complete information about a lamp's spectral composition. Two lamps with the same color temperature can have entirely different spectra.

## Luminous Flux (Lumen)

Luminous flux is measured in lumens (lm) and indicates the total amount of visible light emitted by a source in all directions. It is one of the primary specifications listed by lamp manufacturers.

Typical luminous flux values:

- 100 W incandescent bulb — approximately 1,300 lm
- 23 W CFL (compact fluorescent) — approximately 1,500 lm
- 250 W HPS — approximately 28,000 lm
- 400 W HPS — approximately 48,000 lm
- 100 W LED panel — 10,000 to 20,000 lm (depending on quality)

**Limitation of lumens for growers:** Lumens are weighted for human eye sensitivity, not plant sensitivity. The human eye is most sensitive to green light (555 nm), which plants actually use less efficiently. Therefore, to accurately assess how effective a light is for plants, it is better to use radiometric units (PAR, PPFD).

## Illuminance (Lux)

Illuminance is measured in lux (lx) and indicates how much luminous flux falls on a unit of area. One lux equals one lumen per square meter (1 lx = 1 lm/m²).

Approximate illuminance values:

- Full moon — approximately 0.5 lx
- Office space — 300–500 lx
- Overcast day outdoors — 1,000–2,000 lx
- Direct sunlight — 50,000–100,000 lx

For plants in a grow box, the minimum illuminance is approximately 5,000 lx, with an optimal range of 20,000 to 50,000 lx depending on the growth stage and plant species. A lux meter is an affordable instrument that can help a beginner grower evaluate illuminance levels.

## Photosynthesis and Light

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, using carbon dioxide and water to produce organic compounds. The key players in this process are pigments — chlorophyll A, chlorophyll B, and carotenoids.

### Pigment Absorption Peaks

- **Chlorophyll A** — the primary pigment. Absorption peaks: 430 nm (blue) and 662 nm (red).
- **Chlorophyll B** — an accessory pigment. Peaks: 453 nm (blue) and 642 nm (red).
- **Carotenoids** — absorb primarily in the 400–500 nm range (blue-violet).

This means plants most actively use blue and red light. Green light is reflected by leaves (which is why we see plants as green), although modern research shows that green light also contributes to photosynthesis by penetrating deeper layers of the leaf.

## The PAR Range

PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation) refers to the wavelength range from 400 to 700 nm that plants use for photosynthesis. This range roughly coincides with visible light but excludes the extreme portions of ultraviolet and infrared radiation.

The most important metrics for growers are measured within the PAR range:

- **PPF** (Photosynthetic Photon Flux) — the total photon flux in the PAR range, measured in micromoles per second (umol/s).
- **PPFD** (Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density) — the photon flux density per unit area, measured in umol/(s·m²) or umol/s/m².

PPFD is the most accurate and relevant unit for evaluating the quality of plant lighting. Target PPFD values depend on the crop and growth stage, typically ranging from 200 to 800 umol/s/m².

## Basic Units of Measurement: Summary Table

| Quantity | Unit | What It Measures | Relevance to Growers |
|---|---|---|---|
| Wavelength | nm (nanometer) | Color of light | Determines spectral composition |
| Color temperature | K (Kelvin) | Hue of white light | Simplified spectral guide |
| Luminous flux | lm (lumen) | Total visible light output | Basic lamp specification |
| Illuminance | lx (lux) | Luminous flux per area | Easily measured with a lux meter |
| Radiant power | W (watt) | Radiant energy per unit time | Power consumption specification |
| PPF | umol/s | Photon flux in the PAR range | Plant-specific lamp specification |
| PPFD | umol/s/m² | Photon density per area | The key metric for growers |

## Practical Takeaways

For a beginner grower, it is enough to remember a few key points:

- **Plants need light in the 400–700 nm range** (PAR). Blue light (around 450 nm) promotes vegetative growth, while red light (around 660 nm) promotes flowering.
- **Lumens and lux** are convenient but imperfect units for evaluating plant lighting. They are calibrated for human vision.
- **PPFD** is the most accurate unit for assessing plant lighting quality, but measuring it requires a specialized instrument (quantum sensor).
- **Color temperature** is a simple guide: 6500 K for vegetation, 2700 K for flowering, full spectrum for a universal option.
- When choosing a lamp, pay attention not only to power consumption but also to luminous flux and efficiency (lm/W or umol/J).

Understanding these basic concepts will help you make informed decisions about selecting and configuring lighting, avoiding common mistakes and unnecessary expenses.
