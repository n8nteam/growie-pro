# CFL Quality Guide

Compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) are widely used by beginner growers thanks to their availability and ease of connection. However, CFL quality on the market varies enormously: from decent lamps by reputable manufacturers to outright junk with inflated specifications. In this article, we will examine how to distinguish a good CFL from a bad one and what to look for when buying.

## Actual Wattage vs Advertised

This is the most common problem with cheap CFLs. One wattage is printed on the packaging, while the actual consumption is significantly lower.

Typical examples:

- A lamp labeled 105 W actually draws 65–75 W
- An "85 W" lamp turns out to be 50–60 W
- A "200 W" lamp — practically nonexistent in CFL format; the real values are 80–120 W

How to verify actual wattage:

- **Watt meter (energy meter)**: plug the lamp through a watt meter into an outlet and check the real consumption. The device is inexpensive and pays for itself in any electrical work
- **Lamp weight**: a quality 85 W CFL weighs 400–600 g. If the lamp is suspiciously light, the wattage is likely inflated
- **Size**: the higher the wattage, the larger the spiral tube. A compact lamp claiming 100+ W should raise suspicion

## CFL Manufacturers

### Quality Manufacturers

- **Osram (Dulux)**: German quality, accurate specifications, high color rendering index. Price above average
- **Philips (Tornado, Genie)**: consistent quality, wide lineup. Good value for money
- **General Electric**: American brand, reliable lamps, but limited selection of high-wattage models
- **Sylvania**: good quality, popular in Europe

### Mid-Range Segment

- **Navigator**: acceptable quality for budget solutions
- **Camelion**: Chinese manufacturing under an international brand, results are unpredictable
- **TDM Electric**: decent low-wattage lamps

### Questionable Brands

- No-name Chinese lamps from marketplaces: specifications often inflated by 1.5–2 times
- Lamps with unknown brands and suspiciously low prices at high claimed wattages

## Brightness Degradation

All fluorescent lamps are subject to degradation — a decline in luminous flux over time. This is a normal process, but its rate depends heavily on lamp quality.

### Quality Lamps

- After 2,000 hours of operation: luminous flux drops by 5–10%
- After 6,000 hours: drops by 15–20%
- After 10,000 hours: drops by 25–30%

### Cheap Lamps

- After 2,000 hours: drops by 20–30%
- After 4,000 hours: drops by 40–50%
- After 6,000 hours: the lamp is practically useless for growing

For a grower, this means a cheap CFL bought at half price will lose effectiveness twice as fast. Factoring in the inflated initial wattage, the actual output can be 3–4 times lower than expected.

### Causes of Degradation

- Burnout of the phosphor coating on the inner surface of the tube
- Darkening of the tube glass near the electrodes (dark spots appearing)
- Reduced electrode emission
- Changes in gas mixture composition

## Lifespan

The advertised lifespan of CFLs is typically 6,000–15,000 hours. However, the actual lifespan depends on operating conditions:

- **Frequent on/off cycles**: each power cycle shortens the lifespan. For grow boxes, this is not critical since the lamp runs continuously for 12–18 hours
- **Ambient temperature**: the optimal temperature for CFLs is 20–30°C. In a hot grow box, the lamp degrades faster
- **Lamp orientation**: many CFLs are designed to operate base-up. In an inverted position, the electronic ballast overheats, shortening lifespan
- **Voltage stability**: voltage spikes accelerate electronic ballast wear

Under grow box conditions (high temperature, 12–18 hours of operation), the realistic lifespan of a quality CFL is 6,000–8,000 hours, or approximately 1–1.5 years of continuous use.

## Light Output Flicker

Flicker — fluctuations in lamp brightness at a frequency invisible to the eye but potentially affecting plants.

### What Is Flicker

Fluorescent lamps with a magnetic ballast flicker at 100 Hz (double the mains frequency). CFLs have a built-in electronic ballast that increases the frequency to 20–50 kHz, making flicker virtually imperceptible.

### Electronic Ballast Quality

Cheap CFLs may have a simplified electronic ballast design, leading to:

- Increased flicker at frequencies visible to the eye (below 300 Hz)
- Stroboscopic effects
- Unstable light output

Quality CFLs have a flicker coefficient below 5%, which does not affect plants.

### How to Check for Flicker

The simplest method is to point your smartphone camera at the lit lamp. If you see scrolling bands on the screen, the flicker is significant. A quality lamp should not produce bands on camera (though this method has limitations and is not a precise measurement).

## Color Temperature

The correct CFL color temperature is important for plant cultivation.

| Color Temperature | Label | Application |
|---|---|---|
| 2700 K | Warm white | Flowering. More red spectrum |
| 4000 K | Neutral white | Universal. Compromise |
| 6400–6500 K | Cool white / daylight | Vegetative growth. More blue spectrum |

Color temperature issues with cheap lamps:

- The actual color temperature may differ from the advertised value by 500–1000 K
- The spectrum may be uneven, with gaps in wavelength ranges important for plants
- Quality lamps have a more complete spectrum with a better color rendering index (CRI > 80)

## Color Rendering Index (CRI/Ra)

The color rendering index shows how complete a spectrum the lamp emits. For plants, this matters:

- **CRI > 80**: a good indicator; the lamp emits light across all areas of the visible spectrum
- **CRI 60–80**: an average indicator; acceptable for basic growing
- **CRI < 60**: an incomplete spectrum; not recommended for plants

Cheap CFLs often have a CRI of 60–70, which is visually unnoticeable but means plants are missing part of the spectrum.

## What to Look for When Buying

### Essential Criteria

- **Brand**: choose well-known manufacturers with a reputation
- **Weight**: a heavier lamp (for its wattage) is usually better than a lighter one
- **Labeling**: the lamp should display wattage, color temperature, CRI, country of manufacture, and certifications
- **Base type**: E27 for lamps up to 55 W, E40 for lamps 65 W and above

### Desirable Criteria

- **Reviews with measurements**: look for reviews where actual wattage has been verified with a watt meter
- **Warranty**: quality manufacturers offer a 1–2 year warranty
- **Packaging**: branded packaging with detailed information in multiple languages
- **Price**: a suspiciously cheap high-wattage lamp is almost certainly a scam

### Red Flags

- Wattage above 125 W for a CFL in E40 format — technically possible, but extremely rare in quality form
- No markings on the lamp itself (only on the box)
- Too compact a size for the claimed wattage
- No manufacturer information

## Recommendations for Growers

- For a first growing experience, CFLs are a good choice: they are safe, inexpensive, and easy to use
- Do not chase maximum wattage — two 55 W lamps are better than one "105 W"
- Use 6400 K CFLs for vegetative growth and 2700 K for flowering, or combine them
- Replace lamps every 6–9 months of active use
- If the growing area exceeds 0.5 m², consider switching to more efficient light sources (LED or HPS)

## Conclusion

CFL quality on the market is very inconsistent. Cheap lamps with inflated specifications can completely disappoint a beginning grower and lead to unsatisfactory results. Spending a little more on a lamp from a reputable manufacturer will give you stable light output, honest wattage, and predictable lifespan. Verify actual wattage with a watt meter and do not trust the numbers on the packaging alone.
