# Using HPS Lamps

High-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps remain one of the most widely used light sources for indoor plant cultivation. Despite the emergence of LED technology, HPS lamps continue to be popular thanks to their proven effectiveness, powerful luminous flux, and favorable spectral composition for the flowering stage. This guide covers all practical aspects of working with HPS lamps.

## Choosing an HPS Lamp for Your Grow Box

When selecting an HPS lamp, you need to consider the growing area and the height of your grow box.

| HPS Wattage | Coverage Area | Minimum Box Height | Luminous Flux |
|---|---|---|---|
| 150 W | 0.36 m² (60×60 cm) | 100 cm | ~15,000 lm |
| 250 W | 0.6 m² (80×80 cm) | 120 cm | ~28,000 lm |
| 400 W | 1 m² (100×100 cm) | 150 cm | ~48,000 lm |
| 600 W | 1.4 m² (120×120 cm) | 180 cm | ~90,000 lm |
| 1000 W | 2 m² (140×140 cm) | 200 cm | ~130,000 lm |

For home grow boxes, 250 W and 400 W lamps are the most popular. The 600 W lamp is considered the most efficient in terms of watts-to-lumens ratio but requires serious ventilation.

## Installation and First Startup

### System Components

An HPS lamp requires the following components to operate:

- **HPS lamp** — the light source itself
- **Ballast (magnetic or electronic)** — limits the current through the lamp
- **Ignitor (IZU)** — provides the starting pulse
- **E40 socket** — for connecting the lamp
- **Reflector** — directs light downward onto the plants
- **Compensating capacitor** — optional, for power factor correction

### Installation Sequence

1. Mount the reflector on adjustable hangers attached to the top of the grow box. Use adjustable hangers so you can change the height.
2. Install the E40 socket in the reflector and verify it is securely fastened.
3. Place the ballast outside the grow box if possible. This will reduce the temperature inside the box.
4. Connect all components according to the wiring diagram (ballast — ignitor — socket).
5. Screw the lamp into the socket. Do not touch the bulb with bare hands — grease marks can cause localized overheating and shorten the lamp's lifespan.
6. Turn on the system and wait for the lamp to fully warm up (5–10 minutes).

### First Startup

During the first startup, the lamp may flicker or produce unstable light for several minutes — this is normal. Full stabilization of the luminous flux occurs within 10–15 minutes. If the lamp does not ignite within 30 seconds or keeps cycling on and off, check the ignitor and verify the wiring.

Important: after turning off an HPS lamp, you must wait at least 5–10 minutes before turning it back on. A hot lamp will not ignite — the sodium vapor pressure inside the bulb is too high for the ignitor's starting pulse.

## Distance to Plants

The correct distance from the lamp to the plant canopy is critically important. Too close — leaf burns; too far — stretching and insufficient light.

| Wattage | Minimum Distance | Optimal Distance |
|---|---|---|
| 150 W | 15 cm | 20–30 cm |
| 250 W | 20 cm | 30–40 cm |
| 400 W | 30 cm | 40–50 cm |
| 600 W | 40 cm | 50–60 cm |
| 1000 W | 50 cm | 60–80 cm |

A simple test: hold your hand at the level of the plant tops for 30 seconds. If your hand feels uncomfortably hot, raise the lamp.

## Light Schedule

For most plants, the following light schedules are used:

- **Vegetative stage**: 18 hours of light / 6 hours of darkness (18/6). Some growers use 20/4 or even 24/0 schedules.
- **Flowering stage**: 12 hours of light / 12 hours of darkness (12/12). This schedule triggers flowering in photoperiod plants.
- **Autoflowering varieties**: 18/6 or 20/4 throughout the entire cycle.

Use a timer for automatic switching. Mechanical timers are cheaper, but electronic timers provide greater accuracy. An unstable light schedule can cause plant stress and hermaphroditism.

## Lamp Replacement

HPS lamps degrade over time. Luminous flux decreases and the spectrum shifts. Replacement guidelines:

- Replace the lamp every 2–3 growing cycles or every 6–12 months of active use
- Signs of degradation: the lamp takes a long time to ignite, flickers, the light color has changed (becoming more pinkish), yield has decreased under otherwise identical conditions
- Before replacement, let the lamp cool down completely (at least 30 minutes)
- Do not dispose of old HPS lamps in household waste — they contain sodium and mercury; take them to a recycling facility

## Electronic Ballast Maintenance

An electronic ballast is a more modern alternative to a magnetic choke. Electronic ballast maintenance includes:

- **Dust cleaning**: blow out the ventilation openings with compressed air every 2–3 months
- **Temperature monitoring**: the electronic ballast should not overheat. The housing temperature should not exceed 80°C. Ensure free air circulation around the unit
- **Connection inspection**: periodically check terminals and wires for oxidation and loose contacts
- **Placement**: the electronic ballast is best placed outside the grow box, on a non-combustible surface, in a well-ventilated location

Magnetic chokes require less maintenance but generate more heat and produce a characteristic hum.

## Common Mistakes When Using HPS Lamps

- **No ventilation**: HPS lamps generate an enormous amount of heat. Without adequate ventilation, the temperature inside the grow box can exceed 40°C, which is lethal for plants
- **Lamp positioned too close**: causes burned tops and bleached leaves
- **Using without a reflector**: up to 50% of luminous flux is lost
- **Touching the bulb with bare hands**: grease causes localized glass overheating
- **Mismatched ballast and lamp wattage**: a 400 W lamp on a 250 W ballast will not deliver its rated performance and will fail quickly
- **Attempting to restart a hot lamp**: futile attempts wear out the ignitor
- **No timer**: manual switching inevitably leads to schedule disruptions

## Safety

Working with HPS lamps requires following safety rules:

- All electrical connections must be made properly, using terminal blocks or soldering
- Grounding of all metal parts (reflector, ballast housing) is mandatory
- Do not allow water to contact a hot lamp — the bulb can explode
- Use wires of appropriate gauge (at least 1.5 mm² for HPS up to 400 W, at least 2.5 mm² for 600–1000 W)
- Place the ballast on a non-combustible surface, away from flammable materials
- Do not leave the operating system unattended for extended periods, especially during the first days of operation
- Install a smoke detector in the room with the grow box

## Ventilation When Using HPS

Effective ventilation is a mandatory requirement when working with HPS lamps.

### Ventilation Calculation

The minimum exhaust fan capacity is calculated using the formula: grow box volume (m³) × 60 = fan capacity (m³/h). For HPS, this figure should be multiplied by a factor of 1.5–2.

### Airflow Organization

- **Cool Tube**: a glass tube through which airflow passes, cooling the lamp. Allows reducing the distance to plants by 30–50%
- **Intake fan**: supplies fresh air from the bottom of the box
- **Exhaust fan**: removes hot air from the top
- **Carbon filter**: installed on the exhaust to eliminate odors

Target temperature at the plant canopy level: 24–28°C with lights on and 18–22°C during the dark period. The difference between daytime and nighttime temperatures should not exceed 10°C.

## Conclusion

HPS lamps are a reliable and time-tested tool for home horticulture. With proper installation, adequate ventilation, and adherence to safety practices, HPS delivers excellent results. The key is to match the lamp wattage to the grow box size, ensure sufficient heat removal, and replace the lamp in a timely manner as it degrades.
