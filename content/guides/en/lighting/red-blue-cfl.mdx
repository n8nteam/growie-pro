# Red and Blue CFLs

The question of spectrum choice is one of the most discussed topics among growers who use fluorescent lamps. Red (warm) and blue (cool) CFLs, phyto lamps with special phosphors, combinations and ratios — let's break it all down, separating marketing from real science.

## Fundamentals of Plant Spectral Perception

Before discussing specific lamps, it's important to understand how plants perceive light. Photosynthesis is carried out by several pigments:

- Chlorophyll A — absorption peaks at 430 nm (blue) and 662 nm (red)
- Chlorophyll B — absorption peaks at 453 nm (blue) and 642 nm (red)
- Carotenoids — absorption in the 400–500 nm range (blue and violet)
- Phytochrome — two forms: Pr (absorbs red at 660 nm) and Pfr (absorbs far-red at 730 nm)

The Pr/Pfr ratio controls essential processes: seed germination, stem elongation, flowering initiation, and circadian rhythms.

Additionally, green light (500–580 nm), long considered useless, penetrates deeper into the leaf and lower canopy levels, contributing to overall photosynthesis.

## Red CFLs (2700K) for Flowering

CFLs with a color temperature of 2700K (marked "827" or "830") emit warm yellowish light with a dominant orange-red spectrum.

### Spectral Composition at 2700K

- Blue region (400–500 nm): 8–12%
- Green region (500–580 nm): 25–30%
- Yellow-orange region (580–620 nm): 30–35%
- Red region (620–700 nm): 20–28%
- Far-red region (700–780 nm): 3–5%

### Why 2700K for Flowering

The dominance of red and orange spectrum mimics autumn sunlight at a low angle above the horizon. The plant interprets this as a signal of approaching winter and switches to flowering and fruiting mode.

Red light (660 nm) activates phytochrome Pr, converting it to the Pfr form. A high Pfr/Pr ratio stimulates:

- Internode elongation (to a certain degree)
- Formation of flower buds
- Development of flowers and fruit
- Biomass accumulation

### Usage Recommendations

Use 2700K lamps as the primary light during the flowering stage (12/12 light schedule). An optimal combination is 70–80% of lamps at 2700K with 20–30% at 6500K — the blue component supports photosynthesis and prevents excessive stretching.

## Blue CFLs (6500K) for Vegetation

CFLs with a color temperature of 6500K (marked "865") emit cool bluish-white light with an enhanced blue component.

### Spectral Composition at 6500K

- Blue region (400–500 nm): 22–30%
- Green region (500–580 nm): 30–35%
- Yellow-orange region (580–620 nm): 18–22%
- Red region (620–700 nm): 12–18%
- Far-red region (700–780 nm): 2–3%

### Why 6500K for Vegetation

The elevated blue content mimics summer sunlight at its zenith. The plant receives a signal of long days and an active growing season.

Blue light activates cryptochromes and phototropins, which:

- Suppress stem elongation (photomorphogenesis)
- Stimulate stomatal opening and gas exchange
- Enhance chlorophyll synthesis
- Promote branching
- Direct growth toward the light source (phototropism)

Result: compact plants with thick stems, short internodes, and abundant foliage — the ideal foundation for subsequent flowering.

## Combining Red and Blue

Optimal ratios depend on the growth stage:

| Stage | 6500K | 2700K | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-------|-----------|
| Germination | 100% | 0% | Maximum blue for strong sprouts |
| Seedling | 80% | 20% | Blue prevents stretching |
| Vegetation | 60–70% | 30–40% | Blue for structure, red for photosynthesis |
| Pre-flower | 50% | 50% | Transition period |
| Flowering | 20–30% | 70–80% | Red for flower formation |
| Ripening | 10% | 90% | Maximum red for the final stage |

In practice, few people change lamps 6 times per cycle. Usually two sets are used: a "vegetative" set (more 6500K) and a "flowering" set (more 2700K), switching once when the light schedule changes.

## Phyto-Fluorescent CFLs

The market offers specialized "phyto" CFLs (and linear phyto lamps) marketed as optimized for plants. They emit a characteristic pink-purple light.

### How They're Designed

Phyto-fluorescent lamps use special phosphors with two pronounced emission peaks:

- Blue peak around 440–450 nm (matching chlorophyll B absorption)
- Red peak around 660 nm (matching chlorophyll A absorption)

The green portion of the spectrum is virtually absent — which is why the light looks pink.

### Examples of Phyto Lamps

- Osram Fluora T8 (linear) — a phyto lighting classic, pink light
- Camelion Fito E27 — compact phyto lamp
- Sylvania Grolux — linear phyto lamp with enhanced red
- Various Chinese-made "phyto CFLs"

### Real-World Effectiveness

Here's where it gets interesting. Despite marketing claims about a "special spectrum for plants," phyto-fluorescent lamps have serious drawbacks:

- Overall luminous efficiency (lm/W) is significantly lower than standard CFLs. A 36 W phyto lamp produces 1300 lm, while a standard 36 W T8 produces 3350 lm.
- Two narrow peaks don't cover the entire spectrum plants need. The contributions of green light, carotenoids, and anthocyanins are ignored.
- Phyto lamp cost is 2–4 times higher than standard equivalents.
- Pink light is extremely inconvenient for visual plant diagnostics — it's impossible to identify chlorosis, deficiencies, or pests.

### Scientific Research

Numerous comparative tests (both amateur and scientific) show that a combination of standard 2700K + 6500K CFLs in the right proportions delivers results comparable to or exceeding specialized phyto lamps. The reason — higher total light output at the same power consumption.

## Should You Buy Phyto CFLs or Standard Ones

The clear recommendation: for CFL growing, use standard 2700K and 6500K lamps. Here's why:

- For the price of one 36 W phyto lamp, you can buy two standard 36 W T8 tubes, getting 5 times more total light output.
- By combining 2700K and 6500K, you cover the entire PAR range with sufficient intensity.
- Standard lamps are available everywhere — phyto lamps require specialty stores.
- Visual plant monitoring under white light is incomparably more convenient than under pink light.

Exception: if you received a phyto lamp for free or at the price of a standard one — use it. It won't cause harm, and the narrow-spectrum emission can be a useful supplement to your main white light.

## Alternative Spectrums

In addition to the standard 2700K and 6500K, CFLs are available in intermediate color temperatures:

- 3000K — slightly more balanced warm light, suitable for flowering
- 4000–4200K — neutral white, a universal spectrum for the full cycle
- 5000K — daylight, close to 6500K but softer

Lamps at 4000–4200K are an interesting universal option for those who don't want to swap lamps between stages. They provide enough blue for vegetation and enough red for acceptable flowering, though they are outperformed by specialized combinations.

Choosing a CFL spectrum isn't magic — it's basic biology. By understanding plant needs at each stage, you can select the optimal lamp combination without overpaying for marketing promises.
