# Glass and Heat-Resistant Glass: Testing

When building a Cool Tube, air-cooled reflector, or protective shield between the lamp and plants, glass selection is critically important. Regular window glass can crack from heat, while specialized heat-resistant glass costs several times more. Let us examine which glass suits different applications, how to test thermal resistance, and how much light is lost passing through the glass.

## Types of Glass

### Regular Glass (Soda-Lime Silicate)

This is standard window glass, used for windows, aquariums, and glass jars. Composition: approximately 72% SiO2, 14% Na2O, 10% CaO, and additives.

Characteristics:

- Coefficient of linear expansion: 8-9 x 10^-6 /degrees C
- Maximum working temperature: 150-200 degrees C (short-term)
- Allowable temperature differential: 40-60 degrees C
- Light transmission (visible range): 87-90%

### Borosilicate Glass (Heat-Resistant Glass)

Glass with added boron oxide (B2O3), which significantly reduces the thermal expansion coefficient. Well-known brands: Pyrex, Simax, Duran.

Characteristics:

- Coefficient of linear expansion: 3.2-3.5 x 10^-6 /degrees C (2.5 times lower than regular glass)
- Maximum working temperature: 400-500 degrees C
- Allowable temperature differential: 150-200 degrees C
- Light transmission (visible range): 90-92%

### Tempered Glass

Regular glass that has undergone heat treatment (heated to 600 degrees C followed by rapid cooling). 5-7 times stronger than regular glass; when it breaks it shatters into small, safe fragments.

Characteristics:

- Expansion coefficient: same as regular glass
- Better thermal resistance than regular glass, but worse than borosilicate
- Allowable temperature differential: 80-120 degrees C
- Cannot be drilled or cut after tempering

### Comparison Table

| Parameter | Regular | Tempered | Borosilicate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Allowable differential, degrees C | 40-60 | 80-120 | 150-200 |
| Max working temperature | 150 degrees C | 200 degrees C | 450 degrees C |
| Light transmission | 87-90% | 87-90% | 90-92% |
| Relative cost | 1x | 1.5-2x | 3-5x |
| Can be cut/drilled | Yes | No | Yes |
| Breakage safety | Large shards | Small pieces | Large shards |

## Thermal Shock Tests

### What Is Thermal Shock

Thermal shock is a sudden temperature change that causes uneven expansion or contraction of glass. One part of the glass expands (heated zone) while another remains cold. The resulting stress exceeds the strength limit, and the glass cracks.

In a grow box, thermal shock can occur when:

- Turning on a lamp near cold glass
- Cold water splashing onto a hot Cool Tube glass
- Suddenly turning on a powerful fan blowing cold air onto hot glass
- Ventilation shutting off while the lamp is still on (glass overheats)

### Test 1: Boiling Water on Cold Glass

Method: glass at room temperature (20 degrees C) is doused with boiling water (100 degrees C). Differential: 80 degrees C.

Results:

- Regular glass, 4 mm: cracked in 7 out of 10 cases
- Regular glass, 3 mm: cracked in 5 out of 10 cases (thinner glass heats through faster)
- Tempered glass, 4 mm: no damage
- Borosilicate glass, 3 mm: no damage

### Test 2: Cold Water on Hot Glass

Method: glass is heated on a hotplate to 150 degrees C, then cold water (15 degrees C) is dripped onto it. Differential: 135 degrees C.

Results:

- Regular glass: instant failure
- Tempered glass: cracked in 6 out of 10 cases
- Borosilicate glass: no damage

### Test 3: Cool Tube Simulation

Method: a glass tube with a 250W HPS inside, with and without ventilation.

Without ventilation (dangerous test, conduct at safe distance):

- Regular glass: within 3-5 minutes wall temperature reaches 180-220 degrees C. High risk of failure, especially with uneven heating
- Borosilicate glass: same temperature, but the glass holds

With ventilation (normal operation):

- Glass wall temperature: 60-90 degrees C with adequate airflow
- Regular glass survives under normal conditions, but any ventilation failure (fan stopping) sharply increases risk
- Borosilicate glass has a safety margin even during brief ventilation interruptions

## Light Loss Through Glass

### Measurement Method

A lux meter (or PAR meter) is placed at a fixed distance from the lamp. First, illumination is measured without glass, then a glass pane is placed between the lamp and sensor. The difference in readings represents the loss.

### Measurement Results

| Glass Type | Thickness | Visible Light Loss | PAR Loss (400-700 nm) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Regular silicate | 3 mm | 8-10% | 9-11% |
| Regular silicate | 4 mm | 10-12% | 11-13% |
| Regular silicate | 5 mm | 12-15% | 13-16% |
| Borosilicate | 3 mm | 6-8% | 7-9% |
| Borosilicate | 5 mm | 8-10% | 9-11% |
| Tempered | 4 mm | 9-11% | 10-12% |

Losses consist of:

- **Surface reflection** -- approximately 4% per surface (glass has 2 surfaces -- entry and exit), totaling about 8%
- **Absorption within the glass** -- depends on thickness and impurities, 1-5%
- **Greenish glass** (with elevated Fe2O3 content) absorbs more in the red part of the spectrum -- undesirable for plants

### How to Minimize Losses

- Use the minimum necessary thickness (3 mm for Cool Tubes, 4 mm for protective shields)
- Choose ultra-clear glass (low-iron glass) -- 2-3% less loss due to reduced iron content
- Keep the glass clean -- dust and residue add 3-5% loss
- Borosilicate glass transmits 2-3% more at equal thickness

## Glass Thickness

### For Cool Tubes

- HPS 150-250W: 3 mm (borosilicate) or 4 mm (regular/tempered) is sufficient
- HPS 400W: minimum 3.5 mm (borosilicate) or 5 mm (tempered)
- HPS 600W: minimum 4-5 mm (borosilicate only)

### For Air-Cooled Reflector Shields

The glass sits horizontally and absorbs IR radiation from the lamp:

- Minimum 4 mm for any lamp
- Tempered is preferred -- safer if it breaks
- Borosilicate is the optimal choice

## Where to Buy

### Borosilicate Glass

- Laboratory supply stores -- tubes and plates in various sizes
- Online lab-supply retailers
- AliExpress -- borosilicate glass tubes in various diameters
- Glassblowing workshops -- custom orders

### Tempered Glass

- Glass-cutting workshops -- tempering of standard glass to your dimensions
- Hardware stores -- tempered glass shelves (can be matched by size)

### Regular Glass

- Any glass shop -- cut to size
- Hardware stores -- window glass sheets

When choosing glass for a Cool Tube, the recommendation is clear: if the budget allows, go with borosilicate. It is safer, transmits more light, and lasts longer. If the budget is tight, tempered glass with continuously running ventilation delivers acceptable results.
