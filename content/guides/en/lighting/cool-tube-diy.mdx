# How to Build a Cool Tube

A Cool Tube is a device for cooling high-intensity discharge lamps (HPS, MH) inside a grow box. It consists of a glass tube enclosing the lamp, with air drawn through the tube to carry away heat. A Cool Tube can lower the box temperature by 5-10 degrees C and lets you hang the lamp closer to the plants.

## Why You Need a Cool Tube

HPS and MH lamps produce enormous amounts of heat. A 400W HPS converts roughly 250-280W of power into heat. In the enclosed space of a grow box, this quickly pushes temperatures to critical levels.

Problems caused by overheating:

- Temperatures above 30 degrees C slow growth and reduce yield
- At 35 degrees C and above, heat stress and leaf burn are likely
- The minimum safe distance from a bare 400W HPS to the canopy is 40-50 cm, which eats into usable box height
- The overheating problem worsens in summer

A Cool Tube solves these problems by isolating the main heat output inside the tube and exhausting it through ductwork.

### Cool Tube Effect

| Parameter | Without Cool Tube | With Cool Tube |
|---|---|---|
| Box temperature (HPS 400W, 100x100 box) | +15-20 degrees C above ambient | +8-12 degrees C above ambient |
| Minimum distance to canopy | 40-50 cm | 20-30 cm |
| Light loss through glass | 0% | 5-8% |
| Net light gain (closer to plants) | -- | +15-25% PPFD |

Despite losing 5-8% of light through the glass, the ability to lower the lamp by 15-20 cm more than compensates -- since light intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance.

## Cool Tube Design

### Main Components

1. **Glass tube** -- the main body, housing the lamp inside
2. **Flanges** -- metal adapters at each end of the tube for connecting ductwork
3. **Socket** -- ceramic E40 (for HPS/MH), mounted in one of the flanges or through the tube wall
4. **Suspension** -- cables or chains for mounting to the box ceiling
5. **Clamps** -- for securing ductwork to the flanges

### Operating Principle

A fan (inline or axial) draws air through the tube. Air passing around the hot lamp heats up and is exhausted outside the box (outdoors or into the general exhaust). The glass tube isolates the hot air from the box atmosphere -- the lamp operates on a separate air circuit.

## Materials

### Glass Tube

Requirements:

- Diameter 125-200 mm (depending on lamp wattage)
- Length 400-600 mm
- Borosilicate (heat-resistant) glass is preferred over regular glass
- Wall thickness 3-5 mm

Where to find one:

- Laboratory glass tubes (lab supplies) -- ideal, heat-resistant
- Glass globes from industrial light fixtures
- Cylindrical glass vases (budget option, but not heat-resistant)
- Custom order from a glassblowing shop

### Flanges

Material: galvanized steel or aluminum, 0.5-1 mm thick.

Flange design:

- Cylindrical section -- fits inside or over the glass tube
- Tapered transition -- narrows down to the duct diameter (typically 100 or 125 mm)
- Seal -- high-temperature sealant or rubber gasket between the flange and glass

### Other Materials

- Ceramic E40 socket
- Heat-resistant wire (rated to 180 degrees C) -- 1-1.5 m
- 100-125 mm clamps -- 2 pieces
- 2 mm steel cable with clamps -- for suspension
- High-temperature sealant (red automotive type, rated to 300 degrees C)
- Aluminum tape

## Tube Dimensions for Different Wattages

| Lamp Wattage | Tube Diameter | Tube Length | Duct Diameter | Min. Fan Capacity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 150W | 125 mm | 350 mm | 100 mm | 120 m3/h |
| 250W | 150 mm | 400 mm | 100 mm | 160 m3/h |
| 400W | 150 mm | 500 mm | 125 mm | 240 m3/h |
| 600W | 200 mm | 550 mm | 150 mm | 350 m3/h |

Important: the tube diameter must be large enough so the lamp does not touch the walls. The gap between the lamp bulb and the glass tube should be at least 20-25 mm on all sides.

## Step-by-Step Assembly

### Step 1. Preparing the Tube

If the tube already has the right diameter and length, great. If it needs cutting, use a tube-cutting glass scorer or an abrasive disc with water cooling. After cutting, smooth the edges with sandpaper (120-240 grit) to remove sharp edges.

### Step 2. Making the Flanges

From sheet metal (galvanized steel or aluminum, 0.5-0.8 mm):

1. Cut a rectangle: width = 80-100 mm, length = pi x (tube diameter + 2 mm)
2. Roll it into a cylinder that fits snugly over the tube (or inside it)
3. Secure the overlap with rivets
4. From a separate piece, cut a tapered reducer from the tube diameter to the duct diameter
5. Join the cylinder and reducer with rivets
6. Seal all joints with aluminum tape or sealant

### Step 3. Mounting the Socket

The E40 socket mounts in one of the flanges:

1. Cut a 42 mm hole in the side wall of the flange (or in the tapered section)
2. Install the ceramic socket, secure with the socket nut
3. Route the wire through the flange to the outside
4. Seal the wire entry point with high-temperature sealant

Alternative: mount the socket on a separate bracket passing through the end of the tube. This makes lamp replacement easier.

### Step 4. Assembly

1. Slide the first flange (with socket) onto one end of the tube
2. Secure with a clamp or aluminum tape
3. Apply high-temperature sealant around the joint
4. Screw the lamp into the socket
5. Slide the second flange onto the other end of the tube
6. Secure the same way

### Step 5. Suspension System

Attach two suspension points (cable or chain) to the flanges or to separate clamps around the tube. Attachment points should be 1/4 of the length from each end so the tube hangs level.

### Step 6. Checking for Leaks

Before connecting to ventilation, turn on the fan and verify:

- Air flows through the tube, not through gaps at the joints
- The flanges are secure
- The lamp does not touch the glass

## Connecting to Ventilation

### Layout 1: Separate Circuit

Fan --> duct --> Cool Tube --> duct --> exhaust to outside

Cooling air is drawn from the room (not from the box) and exhausted outdoors. The box has its own separate exhaust ventilation. This is the most effective layout -- hot air from the lamp never enters the box.

### Layout 2: In-Line

Exhaust fan --> carbon filter --> duct --> Cool Tube --> duct --> exhaust

A single fan handles both box exhaust and lamp cooling. Simpler to set up but less effective: air from the box (already warm) passes through the Cool Tube and heats up further.

### Ventilation Tips

- Use flexible aluminum ducting -- easier to install
- Minimize duct length and the number of bends
- The fan is best placed on the exhaust side (after the Cool Tube), not on the supply side
- Fan capacity -- see the table above, with a 20-30% margin

## Lowering Temperature by 5-10 Degrees C

The actual effect of a Cool Tube depends on many factors:

- Lamp wattage
- Fan capacity
- Duct length and diameter
- Connection layout (separate circuit vs. in-line)
- Ambient air temperature

On average, a Cool Tube lowers box temperature by 5-10 degrees C compared to a bare lamp, all else being equal. For a 600W HPS in a 120x120 box, that is the difference between 38 degrees C (impossible to grow) and 28-30 degrees C (comfortable zone).

A Cool Tube is one of the best investments for a grow box with HID lighting. Build cost is modest, and the payoff is a substantial temperature drop plus the ability to position the lamp closer to your plants.
