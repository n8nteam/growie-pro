# Floodlights for the Grow Box

A floodlight is a self-contained fixture in a weatherproof housing with a built-in reflector, designed to operate under tough conditions. Some growers use residential and commercial floodlights as a light source for plants. This approach has both advantages and serious limitations.

## Types of Floodlights

### LED Floodlights

The most common type today. Available from 10 to 500W. Inside is an LED matrix on an aluminum substrate, a power driver, and a housing with a reflector. Luminous efficacy: 80-130 lm/W depending on quality.

The color temperature of residential LED floodlights is usually 4000-6500K (white light). This is decent for the vegetative stage but a warmer spectrum is preferable for flowering.

### HPS Floodlights

Industrial floodlights with HPS lamps (typically 70, 150, 250, or 400W). They come with a ballast (built-in or external), reflector, and protective glass.

### MH Floodlights

Floodlights with metal halide lamps. The spectrum is better for plants (more complete), but these are less commonly available.

## Advantages of Using Floodlights

### Ready-Made Housing and Reflector

A floodlight is a finished product. No need to buy a separate reflector, socket, or assemble wiring. Everything is already integrated, tested, and certified. For a beginner grower, this reduces the risk of electrical assembly mistakes.

### Moisture and Dust Protection

Most floodlights are rated IP65 or higher. In a grow box environment where humidity can be elevated, this is an important advantage. Standard sockets and reflectors do not offer such protection.

### Built-In Heat Sink

LED floodlights come with a heatsink for dissipating heat from the LEDs. HPS floodlights have a ventilated housing. This simplifies temperature management.

### Availability and Price

Residential LED floodlights cost from a few to several dozen dollars (10-100W). Industrial HPS floodlights are moderately priced. This is often cheaper than specialized grow lights.

## Drawbacks of Floodlights for Plants

### Non-Optimal Spectrum

This is the main problem. Consumer floodlights are designed for illuminating outdoor areas, facades, and workspaces -- not for photosynthesis. Their spectrum is optimized for human vision, not plant needs.

Key differences from grow lights:

- Heavy on green and yellow light (500-580 nm), which plants use inefficiently
- Insufficient deep red (650-680 nm) and far red (720-740 nm)
- Excess UV in some models (harmful at high intensity)

As a result, per watt of consumed power, a floodlight delivers less photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) than a dedicated grow light.

| Light Source | Efficiency (umol/J) |
|---|---|
| Quality LED grow light | 2.5-3.0 |
| White LED floodlight 4000K | 1.5-2.0 |
| HPS 400W | 1.7-1.9 |
| HPS floodlight 250W | 1.4-1.7 |

### Heat Output

HPS floodlights generate significant heat. In a closed box, a 250W HPS floodlight can raise the temperature by 10-20 degrees C. The floodlight housing makes heat extraction harder compared to an open Cooltube.

LED floodlights produce less heat, but the rear-mounted heatsink dissipates less effectively in an enclosed box than in open air.

### Beam Angle

Floodlights typically have a beam angle of 90-120 degrees. For a grow box this can be a plus or a minus. In a small box, a wide angle is wasteful -- light hits the walls. In a large box, coverage may be insufficient.

### Size and Weight

HPS floodlights with a built-in ballast are heavy (5-15 kg) and bulky. Fitting them into a compact box can be challenging.

## How to Choose a Floodlight for Growing

### LED Floodlights: What to Look For

- **Actual wattage** -- many cheap floodlights overstate wattage. A "100W" unit may actually draw 50-70W. Verify with a watt meter
- **Color temperature** -- 5000-6500K for vegetation, 2700-3000K for flowering, 3500-4000K as a compromise
- **CRI (Color Rendering Index)** -- the higher, the fuller the spectrum. CRI 90+ is preferable for plants over CRI 70
- **Driver quality** -- a good driver does not flicker or overheat. Cheap floodlights often fail because of the driver
- **Brand** -- reputable brands are preferable to no-name imports

### HPS Floodlights

- **Ballast type** -- electronic ballast is preferable to magnetic (less heat, higher efficiency)
- **Lamp wattage** -- 150-250W for a 60x60 box, 400W for 100x100
- **Lamp replaceability** -- make sure you can install a lamp from a different manufacturer
- **Housing ventilation** -- a sealed IP65 housing dissipates heat worse than one with ventilation openings

## Modifying Floodlights for Growing

### Swapping LEDs in an LED Floodlight

Advanced growers disassemble LED floodlights and replace the white LED matrix with a grow-spectrum matrix (red-blue or full spectrum). The housing, heatsink, driver, and glass are retained. This requires soldering skills and choosing a compatible matrix by voltage and current.

### Supplementing the Spectrum

A simpler option -- use the white LED floodlight as the main source and add red LED strips (660 nm) for spectral correction. No disassembly required.

### Removing the Protective Glass

A floodlight's protective glass absorbs 5-10% of the light. If the floodlight is used in a dry box, the glass can be removed to increase light output. However, moisture and particle protection is lost.

## When a Floodlight Is a Good Choice

- A first grow on a minimal budget
- A temporary solution before buying dedicated grow lighting
- Seedling and clone lighting (low spectral demands)
- Supplemental source in a large box (lighting dark zones)

## When a Floodlight Is a Poor Choice

- Primary source for flowering (non-optimal spectrum, low PAR efficiency)
- A small box with limited ventilation (overheating risk)
- Serious cultivation where yield and quality matter

A floodlight is a compromise. It works, and plants will grow under it, but the output per watt of consumed energy will be lower than with a purpose-built solution. If the budget allows, invest in a grow light from the start. If not, a floodlight will deliver results -- just not the best ones.
