# LED Lighting FAQ — Part 2

We continue answering questions about LED lighting for plants. In this part, we cover more technical aspects: choosing drivers, types of LED boards, cooling, soldering, and operating LED fixtures.

## How to Choose a Driver for an LED Fixture?

The driver (LED power supply) is one of the most important components of a fixture. An incorrect driver choice will lead to premature LED failure or operation at reduced power.

### Key Driver Parameters

- **Output current (mA)**: must match the LED operating current. Typical values: 700 mA, 1050 mA, 1400 mA, 2100 mA
- **Output voltage range (V)**: must cover the total forward voltage of all series-connected LEDs
- **Power (W)**: must be equal to or slightly above the total LED power
- **Regulation type**: LEDs need a constant current (CC) driver, not a constant voltage (CV) one

### Popular Driver Series

| Series | Power | Features | Application |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mean Well HLG | 40–600 W | Sealed, high reliability, dimming | Main fixtures |
| Mean Well ELG | 75–300 W | Similar to HLG, slightly cheaper | Main fixtures |
| Mean Well LPC | 20–100 W | Compact, budget | Small projects |
| Mean Well XLG | 25–240 W | Programmable current | Flexible setups |

### Calculation Example

For a quantum board with 4 strips of 56 Samsung LM301B LEDs each, connected in series-parallel (2 parallel chains of 2 strips):

- Forward voltage of one diode at 65 mA: ~2.75 V
- One chain voltage: 112 diodes × 2.75 V = 308 V (too high for a single chain)
- Better: 4 parallel chains of 56 diodes: voltage = 56 × 2.75 = 154 V, current = 4 × 65 mA = 260 mA

Select a driver: Mean Well HLG-40H-54 (if strips are connected differently) or another matching the calculated parameters. Always verify compatibility of the specific configuration with the chosen driver.

## What Is a Quantum Board?

A quantum board (QB) is a type of LED fixture in which a large number of low-power SMD LEDs (typically 2835 or 3030 package size) are evenly distributed across a flat printed circuit board.

### Quantum Board Features

- **Uniform light distribution**: hundreds of LEDs on a single board create a homogeneous light field with no hot spots
- **Efficiency**: each diode runs at low current (50–100 mA), which corresponds to the zone of maximum efficiency
- **Minimal heating**: heat is distributed across a large area
- **No lenses required**: wide beam angle (120°) and many point sources ensure uniform coverage
- **Compactness**: board thickness 1.6 mm + heat sink 10–30 mm

### Typical Configurations

- **QB96**: 96 LEDs, coverage area ~0.3–0.5 m²
- **QB288**: 288 LEDs, coverage area ~0.6–1.0 m²
- **QB576**: 576 LEDs (usually two QB288 boards), coverage area ~1.0–1.5 m²

Quantum boards can be purchased ready-made or assembled from individual LED strips.

## Samsung LM301B vs LM301H — What Is the Difference?

Both are high-efficiency white LEDs from Samsung that have become the standard in horticulture. But there are differences between them.

### Samsung LM301B

- Year of release: 2017
- Maximum efficiency: 220 lm/W (at low current)
- Typical efficiency at 65 mA: 200–210 lm/W
- Available color temperatures: 2700 K, 3000 K, 3500 K, 4000 K, 5000 K, 6500 K
- Widely available, many offerings on the market
- Counterfeits are more common

### Samsung LM301H

- Year of release: 2019
- Maximum efficiency: 235 lm/W
- Typical efficiency at 65 mA: 215–225 lm/W
- Improved phosphor application technology
- Better parameter uniformity across batches
- Higher resistance to degradation
- Higher price, fewer counterfeits

### Practical Difference

For the end user, the difference between LM301B and LM301H is 5–10% in efficiency. If your budget allows, go with LM301H. If not, LM301B remains an excellent choice. More importantly, make sure the LEDs are genuine, not counterfeit.

## Active vs Passive LED Cooling

LEDs generate heat that must be dissipated. Overheating reduces efficiency and accelerates degradation.

### Passive Cooling

Heat is dissipated through a heat sink (aluminum profile or plate) without fans.

Pros:

- Completely silent
- No moving parts — nothing to break
- Maintenance-free
- No additional power consumption

Cons:

- Heat sink must be large enough
- Limits maximum power per unit area

Suitable for: quantum boards, low- to medium-power fixtures (up to 200–300 W), grow boxes with good ventilation.

### Active Cooling

Fans are used for forced heat sink airflow.

Pros:

- More compact at the same power
- Smaller heat sink can be used
- More effective heat removal

Cons:

- Fan noise
- Fans wear out and need replacement
- Additional power consumption
- Vibration can loosen connections

Suitable for: high-power COB fixtures, compact builds, industrial setups.

Recommendation: for home grow boxes, passive cooling is preferable. The ventilation of the box itself is usually sufficient to dissipate heat from an LED fixture with a passive heat sink.

## Is a Reflector Needed for LEDs?

Short answer — no. Unlike HPS and CFL, LED fixtures typically do not need a reflector.

Reasons:

- LEDs emit light in one direction (hemisphere, 120–180°), not in all directions
- Quantum boards are mounted horizontally above plants, directing light downward
- Reflective grow box walls (mylar, white paint) already return scattered light

When a reflector can be useful:

- When using COB LEDs with a wide beam angle at great height
- If the grow box has a non-standard shape
- To concentrate light on a specific zone

## How to Solder LEDs?

Soldering SMD LEDs onto strips or boards is a skill needed for DIY projects.

### Equipment

- **Soldering station**: with temperature control (recommended 280–320°C for leaded solder, 320–360°C for lead-free)
- **Tip**: thin conical or chisel, 1–2 mm wide
- **Solder**: Sn63/Pb37, 0.5–0.8 mm diameter (for SMD) or lead-free SAC305
- **Flux**: liquid or gel, neutral (not acid-based)
- **Tweezers**: anti-static with fine tips
- **Magnifying glass or loupe**: SMD 2835 components are very small

### SMD LED Soldering Procedure

1. Apply flux to the board pads
2. Tin one of the pads (apply a drop of solder)
3. Using tweezers, place the LED observing polarity (the cathode mark is usually a green dot or corner cut)
4. While holding with tweezers, heat the tinned pad — the LED will settle onto the solder
5. Solder the second contact
6. Touch up the first contact if needed
7. Keep tip contact time to no more than 2–3 seconds per pad

### Common Mistakes

- **Overheating**: prolonged contact with the soldering iron destroys the LED crystal
- **Reversed polarity**: the LED will not light, and reverse voltage can damage it
- **Cold joint**: dull, matte solder point — unreliable contact
- **Excess solder**: bridging between pads

## How Long Does an LED Fixture Last?

The advertised LED lifespan is 30,000–50,000 hours (3.5–5.7 years of continuous operation). However, the actual lifespan depends on several factors:

- **Junction temperature**: at a junction temperature of 85°C, lifespan is 50,000 hours. At 105°C, it drops to 25,000 hours
- **Operating current**: the higher the current, the faster degradation occurs. Running at 50% of maximum current significantly extends lifespan
- **Driver quality**: current ripple accelerates degradation. Quality drivers provide stable current
- **LED quality**: counterfeit LEDs can degrade 5–10 times faster than genuine ones

The weak link is usually not the LEDs but the driver. Electrolytic capacitors in the driver have a lifespan of 10,000–30,000 hours depending on temperature.

## LED Degradation

LED degradation is a gradual decline in luminous flux over time. Unlike HPS and CFL, where degradation is noticeable within months, LEDs degrade very slowly.

### The L70 Standard

Manufacturers specify lifespan as L70 — the time for luminous flux to drop to 70% of its initial value. For quality diodes, L70 is 30,000–50,000 hours.

### Factors That Accelerate Degradation

- High ambient temperature (above 40°C)
- Operating at maximum current
- Elevated humidity (can damage the phosphor)
- Poor-quality solder (leads to localized overheating)

### How to Slow Degradation

- Ensure adequate cooling (heat sink temperature no higher than 50–60°C)
- Do not exceed the recommended operating current
- Use a quality driver with low ripple
- Protect the fixture from water exposure

## LED Fixture Dimming

Dimming (brightness control) is one of the key advantages of LED over HPS.

### Dimming Methods

- **Analog (1–10 V)**: an external potentiometer sends a 1–10 V control signal to the driver input. The most common method. Most Mean Well HLG/ELG drivers support this
- **PWM**: pulse width modulation at 1–10 kHz. Less commonly used in home fixtures
- **Resistive**: changing resistance on the driver's control input. The simplest option — a 100 kOhm potentiometer

### Why Dimming Is Useful

- **Growth stages**: seedlings need less light than mature plants in flowering. Dimming allows using one fixture across all stages
- **Temperature management**: in hot weather, you can reduce power to lower heat output
- **Energy savings**: no need to always run at full power
- **Gradual sunrise/sunset**: simulating natural lighting reduces plant stress

### Efficiency During Dimming

An interesting property of LEDs: when power is reduced, efficiency (µmol/J) increases. A fixture at 50% power consumes 50% of the electricity but outputs 55–60% of the luminous flux. This is because LED efficiency is higher at lower currents.

## Conclusion

LED technology provides growers with a powerful and flexible tool for managing lighting. The right driver choice, quality LEDs, adequate cooling, and smart use of dimming allow you to create a highly efficient lighting system that will last for years. Do not cut corners on components — the price difference between a cheap and a quality fixture pays for itself through efficiency, yield, and longevity.
