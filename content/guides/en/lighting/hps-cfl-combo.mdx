# HPS + CFL Combined Fixture

Combining a high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamp with compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) is a proven way to improve the spectral quality of your lighting without switching to expensive LED panels. The HPS delivers a powerful light output dominated by red and yellow, while 6400K CFLs add the missing blue component.

## Why Combine HPS and CFL

### The HPS Spectrum Problem

The HPS lamp is the efficiency champion among discharge lamps (up to 150 lm/W). However, its spectrum is concentrated in the yellow-orange-red range (570-630 nm). Blue light (430-460 nm), essential for compact vegetative growth, makes up less than 5% of the total HPS output.

The result of pure HPS during the vegetative stage:

- Stem stretching (the plant reaches for the missing blue light)
- Elongated internodes
- Weak plant structure
- Thin, pale leaves

### What 6400K CFLs Add

Cool white CFLs (6400K) contain a significant share of blue light (up to 25-30% of their spectrum). Adding even a modest amount of CFL wattage to your HPS makes a noticeable difference:

- Compact growth with short internodes
- Thicker stems
- Wide, dark-green leaves
- Better branching

During flowering, you can adjust the ratio: remove the blue CFLs or swap them for warm ones (2700K), or leave them to maintain overall plant shape.

## Placement Layouts

### Layout 1: HPS in the Center, CFLs Around the Perimeter

The classic layout for a 100x100 cm or 120x120 cm square box:

- HPS 400-600W in the center with a reflector
- 2-4 CFLs, 50-85W each (6400K), at the corners or along the sides at canopy height

Advantages: the CFLs illuminate lower branches and side shoots that the HPS light barely reaches. Blue spectrum is distributed evenly.

### Layout 2: In-Line Arrangement

For a rectangular box (60x120 cm):

- HPS 400W in the center, horizontal with reflector
- 2 CFLs, 85-105W (6400K), at the short ends of the box

### Layout 3: Vertical Side Lighting

- HPS overhead with reflector (main light)
- Vertical CFLs placed between plants (supplemental side lighting)

This layout is especially effective for tall plants where lower branches are shaded.

## Wiring Both Lamp Types on One Timer

### Electrical Layout

HPS and CFL have different power requirements:

- **HPS** requires a ballast (electronic ballast or magnetic ballast + ignitor)
- **CFL** plugs into a standard 220V outlet via an E27 or E40 socket (ballast is built in)

Connecting to a single timer:

1. Plug the timer into the wall outlet
2. Connect a power strip or junction box to the timer's output
3. Connect the HPS ballast and lamp to one channel
4. Connect the CFL sockets to other channels

This way, both systems turn on and off simultaneously on one timer.

### Important Notes

- Total wattage must not exceed the timer's rated load (typically 3500W for mechanical timers)
- Use wire with a cross-section of at least 1.5 mm2 for the combined current
- An electronic ballast for HPS draws an additional 10-15% over the lamp's rated wattage
- CFLs have an inrush current higher than operating current -- account for this when choosing a timer

### Separate Timers

In advanced setups, CFLs are connected to a separate timer so you can:

- Turn on blue light 1-2 hours before the HPS (simulating dawn)
- Turn off CFLs after the HPS (simulating dusk)
- Change the CFL schedule when transitioning to flowering

## Power Calculations

### Recommended Ratios

During the vegetative stage, the optimal HPS to CFL (6400K) power ratio:

| HPS | CFL 6400K | Total Power | Area |
|---|---|---|---|
| 250W | 2 x 55W = 110W | 360W | 0.6 x 0.6 m |
| 400W | 2 x 85W = 170W | 570W | 0.8 x 0.8 m |
| 600W | 4 x 55W = 220W | 820W | 1.0 x 1.0 m |
| 600W | 2 x 105W = 210W | 810W | 1.0 x 1.0 m |

CFL share of total power: 25-35% during vegetation, 10-15% during flowering (or 0% if warm-tone CFLs are used instead).

### Formula

The minimum recommended total power for HID lighting is 400-600W per square meter. The bulk of that comes from the HPS. CFL wattage is added on top for spectral correction.

Approximate formula:

- CFL power = HPS power x 0.3 (during vegetation)
- CFL power = HPS power x 0.15 (during flowering)

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: 80x80x180 cm Box

Equipment:

- HPS 400W + electronic ballast + wing reflector
- 2 x 85W CFL 6400K in E40 ceramic sockets
- Mechanical timer rated for 3500W

Schedule: 18/6 during vegetation (all lamps on together), 12/12 during flowering (CFLs swapped to 2700K or disconnected).

Result: compared to HPS 400W alone, plants were 15-20% more compact, internodes shorter, lateral branching more vigorous. Yield did not decrease despite the more compact growth.

### Example 2: 100x100x200 cm Box

Equipment:

- HPS 600W + Cooltube + external reflector
- 4 x 55W CFL 6400K at the box corners

Schedule: 20/4 during vegetation, 12/12 during flowering (2 CFLs kept on for lower canopy supplementation).

Result: excellent light uniformity across the entire area. Lower branches received enough light to develop full flowers. Overall yield increase compared to HPS alone was approximately 10-15%.

## Alternatives

With the advancement of LED technology, the HPS + CFL combination is gradually giving way to:

- **HPS + blue LED strips** -- more energy-efficient and longer-lasting
- **Full-spectrum LED panels** -- replace both lamp types at once, but cost more
- **CMH (Ceramic Metal Halide)** -- already has a balanced spectrum out of the box

Nevertheless, HPS + CFL remains one of the most budget-friendly and proven solutions, especially if you already own an HPS and just need to fine-tune the spectrum with minimal investment.

## Summary

Adding cool-white CFLs to an HPS lamp is a simple and inexpensive way to achieve a more balanced spectrum. It is not a replacement for full-spectrum LED, but for the cost of a couple of CFL bulbs you can noticeably improve growth quality, especially during the vegetative stage.
