# Fluorescent Lamps — Linear and Compact

Fluorescent lamps are among the most affordable and safe light sources for beginner growers. They don't require special equipment, don't overheat plants, and can produce decent results with minimal investment. In this guide, we'll take a detailed look at all types of fluorescent lamps and their applications in plant growing.

## How They Work

A fluorescent lamp is a low-pressure gas-discharge light source. Inside the glass tube is an inert gas (argon) with a small amount of mercury vapor. At each end of the tube are electrodes with tungsten filaments coated with an emissive compound (oxides of barium, strontium, and calcium).

When voltage is applied through the ballast, a glow discharge forms between the electrodes. Current flowing through the gas excites mercury atoms, which emit ultraviolet radiation (primarily at 253.7 nm). This UV radiation strikes the phosphor coating on the inner wall of the tube and is converted into visible light.

The phosphor composition determines the spectral characteristics of the lamp — its color temperature and color rendering index. Modern tri-phosphor coatings provide high CRI (80–98) and a variety of color temperatures.

## Types of Fluorescent Lamps

### T5 Linear Lamps

T5 tubes are 16 mm (5/8 inch) in diameter. They are considered the most efficient among linear fluorescent lamps.

T5 specifications:

- Standard lengths: 549 mm (24 W), 849 mm (39 W), 1149 mm (54 W), 1449 mm (80 W)
- Efficiency: 80–104 lm/W
- HO (High Output) versions produce more light at slightly lower efficiency
- G5 base
- Only work with electronic ballasts

T5 HO is the best choice among linear fluorescents for plant growing. Ready-made fixtures with 2–8 T5 HO lamps are often sold as "grow panels."

### T8 Linear Lamps

T8 tubes are 26 mm (1 inch) in diameter. An older format gradually being replaced by T5.

T8 specifications:

- Standard lengths: 600 mm (18 W), 900 mm (30 W), 1200 mm (36 W), 1500 mm (58 W)
- Efficiency: 60–80 lm/W
- G13 base
- Can work with both magnetic and electronic ballasts

T8 tubes are less efficient than T5, but their main advantage is wide availability and low cost. T8 fixtures can be found in any hardware store.

### CFL — Compact Fluorescent Lamps

CFLs are compact fluorescent lamps with a built-in electronic ballast and a standard E27 or E40 base. The tube is coiled into a spiral or U-shape.

CFL specifications:

- Wattages: from 15 W to 200 W (specialized models for horticulture)
- Efficiency: 50–70 lm/W
- E27 base (up to 55 W) or E40 (85 W and above)
- Built-in electronic ballast — just screw in and go
- Available in various color temperatures

CFLs are the simplest option for getting started. No special fixtures, ballasts, or wiring needed. A ceramic socket and an outlet are all you need.

## Color Temperatures

Choosing the right color temperature is critical for plants:

- 2700 K (warm white) — dominant red-orange spectrum. Optimal for flowering and fruiting. Marked "827" or "830."
- 4000–4200 K (neutral white) — balanced spectrum. A universal option. Marked "840."
- 6400–6500 K (cool daylight) — dominant blue spectrum. Ideal for seedlings, vegetation, and clones. Marked "865."

For full-cycle growing, it's recommended to combine lamps of different temperatures. For example, during vegetation: 2 lamps at 6500K + 1 lamp at 2700K. During flowering: 2 lamps at 2700K + 1 lamp at 6500K.

## Wattages and Requirements

For plant growing, there's a simple rule: a minimum of 100 W of actual fluorescent lamp power per square foot (approximately 30x30 cm), or about 10,000 lumens per square foot for normal growth.

| Area | Min. T5 HO 54 W lamps | Min. CFLs | Expected lumens |
|------|----------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 30x30 cm | 2 pcs | 1x105 W | 8,000–10,000 lm |
| 40x40 cm | 3 pcs | 2x85 W | 14,000–16,000 lm |
| 60x60 cm | 5–6 pcs | 3x105 W | 25,000–30,000 lm |
| 80x80 cm | 8+ pcs | Not practical | 40,000+ lm |

For areas over 60x60 cm, fluorescent lamps become impractical — it's better to switch to HPS or LED.

## Electronic Ballast

An electronic ballast converts the mains frequency of 50 Hz to a high frequency (20–60 kHz), providing:

- No visible flickering (stroboscopic effect)
- 10–15% increase in lamp efficiency
- Instant startup without flickering
- 30–50% increase in lamp lifespan
- No humming typical of magnetic ballasts

For T5 lamps, an electronic ballast is the only option — they don't work with magnetic ballasts. T8 lamps can work with both types, but electronic ballasts are clearly preferable.

CFLs have a built-in electronic ballast, making them the simplest to use.

## Applications for Seedlings and Vegetation

Fluorescent lamps are ideal for several tasks:

### Seedlings and Clones

The soft diffused light of fluorescent lamps won't burn delicate sprouts. Lamps at 6500K placed 5–10 cm from the tops provide sufficient intensity for developing strong seedlings. Light schedule: 18/6 or 20/4.

### Vegetation

With enough lamps, fluorescent lighting ensures good vegetation. Plants develop compact forms with short internodes. It's important to maintain minimal distance to the lamps (5–15 cm), as intensity drops off rapidly with distance.

### Cloning

Minimal lighting is sufficient for rooting clones. A single T5 lamp or 23 W CFL at 6500K creates ideal conditions for root system development.

### Supplemental Lighting

Fluorescent lamps can be used for side lighting to supplement the main light source (HPS or LED), illuminating lower canopy levels.

## Distance to Plants

Proper distance is the key factor for fluorescent lamp effectiveness:

- CFL up to 40 W: 5–10 cm
- CFL 85–125 W: 10–20 cm
- T5 HO: 5–15 cm
- T8: 5–10 cm

Fluorescent lamps virtually won't burn plants, so you can place them as close as possible. The hand test: if it feels comfortable for your hand at that distance, it will be fine for the plants too.

It's important to remember the inverse square law: doubling the distance reduces illumination by a factor of four. For fluorescent lamps, this is critical since their absolute intensity is lower than HPS or LED.

## Advantages of Fluorescent Lamps

- Low entry cost — you can start with minimal investment
- Safety — low surface temperature, minimal fire risk
- Easy installation, especially CFLs
- Soft diffused light that won't burn plants
- No need for powerful ventilation
- Wide range of spectrums
- Good color rendering — convenient for monitoring plant health

## Disadvantages of Fluorescent Lamps

- Low intensity — limited light penetration into the canopy
- Rapid intensity drop-off with distance
- Unable to effectively light an area larger than 60x60 cm
- Weak results during flowering compared to HPS or LED
- Contains mercury (though in small amounts)
- Degrades over time (replace every 10,000–12,000 hours)
- With many lamps, total electricity cost can exceed that of a more efficient LED

## When Fluorescent Lamps Make Sense

Fluorescent lamps are a smart choice when you need to grow seedlings, run vegetation in a small space, or when the budget is strictly limited. For serious flowering and maximum yield, consider HPS or LED. But as a starting platform for beginners or as a tool for micro growing, fluorescent lamps remain an excellent and proven solution.
