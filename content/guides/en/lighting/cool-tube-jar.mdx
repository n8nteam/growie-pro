# Cool Tube from a Glass Jar

A proper Cool Tube made from laboratory glass is a great solution, but a glass tube of the right diameter costs money and is not always available. A budget alternative is a Cool Tube made from a standard 3-liter glass jar. When assembled properly, it works and noticeably lowers the temperature inside a grow box.

## Design Concept

A standard 3-liter jar has a diameter of about 150 mm and a height of about 240 mm. This is enough to fit an HPS 150-250W lamp inside. The jar is positioned mouth-up (or sideways), the lamp is placed inside, and air is drawn through the opening and additional holes.

The design is simpler than a classic Cool Tube: the jar replaces the glass tube, and homemade covers and adapters serve as flanges.

## Required Materials

- 3-liter glass jar (standard, with an 82 mm opening)
- Metal canning lid (82 mm) or metal screw-on lid
- Ceramic E40 socket
- Heat-resistant wire -- 1 m
- Adapter/flange from 80 mm to 100 mm for ductwork (can be made from tin)
- Flexible aluminum duct, 100 mm -- 1-2 m
- 100 mm clamp -- 1 piece
- High-temperature sealant
- Metal suspension (wire, cable)

Tools:

- Drill with a metal bit
- Metal shears
- Pliers
- Screwdriver

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1. Preparing the Lid

In the metal lid (82 mm), drill a 42 mm hole for the E40 socket. If you do not have a hole saw, you can drill the outline with many small holes (3-4 mm bit in a circle), then punch out the center and file smooth.

Mount the ceramic E40 socket in the hole. Secure with the socket nut. Route the heat-resistant wire through a small additional hole in the lid.

### Step 2. Preparing the Jar

The jar needs to be modified for airflow. There are two options:

**Option A: Jar Mouth Up**

The jar sits or hangs with the bottom facing down. The socket-and-lid assembly closes the mouth at the top; the lamp hangs inside base-up. Air enters through a hole in the bottom of the jar.

To make this work, you need to drill a hole in the jar bottom. Glass is drilled with a special glass bit (spade or diamond-core type) with mandatory water cooling. Hole diameter: 40-50 mm. Alternatively, the entire bottom can be removed with a glass cutter.

**Option B: Jar Mouth Sideways (Horizontal)**

The jar hangs horizontally. The mouth points to the side -- ductwork connects through it. The jar bottom is open (cut off with a glass cutter) -- warm air exits into a second duct.

This option is closer to a classic Cool Tube and works more efficiently, but is harder to execute.

### Step 3. Assembly (Option A)

1. Drill a 40-50 mm hole in the jar bottom (or remove the bottom entirely)
2. From tin, make an adapter: a cylinder that fits into the bottom hole (or slips over the jar from below) and tapers to 100 mm for duct connection
3. Seal the joint between the adapter and jar with high-temperature sealant
4. Screw the HPS lamp into the socket on the lid
5. Lower the lamp into the jar and close the lid over the mouth
6. Connect ductwork to the bottom adapter
7. Hang the assembly using a wire frame around the jar

### Step 4. Connecting Ventilation

An exhaust fan (100 mm inline, capacity 120 m3/h or more) connects to the ductwork. Air enters through the top (around the socket -- through the gap between lid and mouth, or through additional holes in the lid), flows around the lamp, heats up, and exits through the bottom adapter into the duct and out.

Flow direction: top to bottom. Hot air naturally rises, but the fan forces it downward and out.

## Limitations

### Only for HPS 150-250W

A 3-liter jar is too small for a 400W HPS, let alone 600W. The gap between the lamp bulb and the jar wall would be less than 15 mm, which risks:

- Glass overheating and cracking
- Insufficient airflow around the lamp
- Jar wall temperatures dangerous for nearby objects

For 400W+ HPS, use a proper Cool Tube from a 150-200 mm diameter glass tube.

### Regular Glass

The jar is made of standard soda-lime glass, not heat-resistant borosilicate. This means:

- Risk of cracking from thermal shock (e.g., cold water splashing on a hot jar)
- Lower safety margin under prolonged heat exposure
- Shorter lifespan compared to laboratory glass

Under normal operation (steady airflow, no mechanical impacts), the jar withstands heat from a 250W HPS for several grow cycles. But inspect the glass periodically for micro-cracks.

### Suboptimal Aerodynamics

The jar's rounded bottom and narrow mouth create uneven airflow. Stagnant zones form in the corners (between the bottom and walls) where air circulates poorly. This reduces cooling efficiency compared to a cylindrical tube.

## Safety

- **Do not use a jar with cracks or chips** -- under heat they will spread, and the jar will shatter
- **Always ensure airflow** -- without ventilation the jar will overheat and may break
- **Do not turn off the fan while the lamp is on** -- and leave the fan running for 5-10 minutes after switching off the lamp to allow cooling
- **Do not touch the jar while the lamp is running** -- glass temperature can reach 80-120 degrees C
- **Secure the jar firmly** -- a falling hot glass jar with a lamp inside is extremely dangerous
- **Do not place the jar on flammable surfaces** -- hang it only

## When It Works

- Budget is tight and a glass tube is unavailable
- Lamp wattage does not exceed 250W
- You need a temporary solution for one or two cycles
- The box is small (60x60 or 80x80 cm) and there is no room for a full-sized Cool Tube

## When It Does Not Work

- HPS 400W and above -- the jar is too small
- Long-term use -- regular glass is less durable
- Horizontal orientation -- cutting the bottom cleanly requires glass-cutting skills
- If you can afford a proper glass tube -- build a real Cool Tube instead

A jar Cool Tube is a hack for budget-minded growers. It does not replace a proper solution, but when assembled carefully it gets the job done and costs next to nothing.
