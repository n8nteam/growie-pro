# Lamp Orientation in the Grow Box

How you position your lamp -- horizontally or vertically -- has a significant impact on light distribution, reflector efficiency, and heat management. The right orientation depends on the lamp type, box design, and the reflector you are using.

## Horizontal Installation

Horizontal mounting is the most common arrangement for high-intensity discharge lamps (HPS, MH). The lamp sits parallel to the floor of the box, with the base off to one side.

### Advantages of Horizontal Orientation

- Maximum reflector compatibility -- most reflectors (wing, parabolic, air-cooled) are designed for a horizontal lamp
- A uniform, rectangular or elliptical light footprint
- Light from the arc (the HPS arc burns horizontally) travels predominantly upward and downward, which is ideal for a reflector
- Easy integration with a Cooltube

### HPS Specifics

When an HPS lamp is mounted horizontally, the arc bends slightly upward due to convection. This is normal and is accounted for in reflector designs. Some HPS models are labeled "BU" (Base Up) or "BD" (Base Down) -- these are designed for vertical orientation only. Universal lamps are labeled "U" (Universal) and work in any position.

### Light Distribution

With a horizontal lamp and reflector, the light footprint at canopy level is an elongated oval. Maximum intensity is directly below the lamp, tapering off gradually toward the edges. Typical values: center PPFD of 800-1000 umol/m2/s, dropping to 300-500 umol/m2/s at the edges (for a 600W HPS at 40 cm with a good reflector).

## Vertical Installation

In a vertical orientation, the lamp points base-up (or base-down), with the bulb running vertically.

### When Vertical Installation Makes Sense

- **CFLs** -- spiral and U-shaped CFLs are often more effective vertically, since their luminous surface is distributed around the axis and light radiates evenly in all directions
- **Vertical SCROG systems** -- plants are arranged around the lamp in a circle, with the lamp hanging vertically in the center
- **Multiple small lamps** -- several vertical CFLs provide more even coverage than a single large horizontal lamp

### Limitations

- Most reflectors do not work with a vertical lamp
- HPS and MH lamps mounted vertically with the base down may overheat near the base (hot gases rise toward it)
- Light losses are higher unless you use a vertical box configuration with reflective walls surrounding the lamp

### Vertical HPS

Vertical HPS mounting is used in cylindrical or polygonal boxes where plants are arranged in a circle. In this case no reflector is used -- instead, the box walls or a small top reflector cap prevents light from escaping upward.

Distribution pattern: light radiates radially from the lamp; intensity drops in inverse proportion to distance. Plants closer to the lamp receive more light; those farther away get less.

## Horizontal HPS + Reflector: The Classic Setup

The most effective combination for a rectangular box:

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Lamp | HPS 400-600W, Universal |
| Reflector | Parabolic or wing |
| Orientation | Horizontal |
| Height above canopy | 30-50 cm |
| Coverage area | 0.8-1.2 m2 |

The reflector captures upward-traveling light from the horizontal lamp and directs it downward. With a well-chosen reflector, up to 90-95% of the light output reaches the growing zone.

## Vertical CFL

A 100-300W CFL in a vertical position is an excellent option for small boxes. The spiral tube emits light radially, and when mounted vertically, most photons are already directed sideways and downward.

Recommendations:

- Install a small top reflector cap (even from scrap materials) to reclaim the light escaping upward
- In a narrow box (40x40 cm), a vertical 150W CFL covers the area more efficiently than a horizontal one
- Several 50-85W CFLs in vertical position deliver better uniformity than a single high-wattage lamp

## Cooltube and Lamp Orientation

A Cooltube is a glass tube through which air is drawn to cool the lamp. By design, a Cooltube requires strictly horizontal lamp orientation. The tube sits horizontally, and the lamp inside it does as well.

Key points:

- The Cooltube itself acts as a partial reflector -- the upper portion of the tube (especially if frosted rather than clear) bounces some light downward
- For maximum efficiency, mount an additional external reflector above the Cooltube
- A vertical Cooltube is technically possible but extremely impractical: airflow will be poor, and the lamp may overheat at the top

## Light Distribution Patterns

### Horizontal lamp without a reflector

Light is distributed roughly equally across the upper and lower hemispheres. About 50% of the light goes to the ceiling, reflects with losses, and scatters. The footprint on the floor is wide but weak.

### Horizontal lamp with a parabolic reflector

Most upward-traveling light is redirected downward. The footprint is bright and focused with a pronounced center peak. Good for tall plants and deep light penetration.

### Horizontal lamp with a wing reflector

Light spreads wider; the footprint is flatter and more elongated. The difference between center and edges is smaller. Optimal for SCROG and short plants.

### Vertical lamp without a reflector

Light radiates radially. Maximum intensity is at the midpoint of the bulb. Above and below that level, intensity drops quickly. Suitable for vertical setups but requires reflective walls.

## Practical Recommendations

- For a standard rectangular box with HPS or MH, use horizontal installation with a reflector
- For a small box with CFLs, try vertical installation with a small top reflector
- Always check the lamp label for permitted orientation (U / BU / BD / HOR)
- With a Cooltube -- horizontal orientation only
- Measure light levels with a lux meter at canopy height -- this shows the real distribution better than any calculation
