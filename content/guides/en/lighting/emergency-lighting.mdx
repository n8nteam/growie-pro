# Emergency Battery-Powered Lighting

Power outages are an unpleasant but very real scenario that can seriously harm your plants. Interruptions are especially dangerous during the flowering stage, when disrupting the photoperiod can cause stress, hermaphroditism, or reversion to vegetative growth. In this article, we will cover how to prepare for such situations.

## Why Light Interruptions Are Dangerous

### Impact on Photoperiod

Plants use the ratio of day to night (photoperiod) as a signal for regulating vital processes. Photoperiod-sensitive plants determine the time of year by the length of the dark period.

During the flowering stage (12/12 schedule), the **uninterrupted dark period** is critical. If light reaches the plant during its 12-hour "night," it may be interpreted as a signal to revert to vegetative growth. But disruptions to the light period also carry risks:

- **Irregular lighting** — disrupts the plant's internal clock
- **Extended dark period (over 14 hours)** — can trigger stress
- **Interrupting the dark period with light** — can cause hermaphroditism or reversion to vegetation

### Consequences for Plants

For a single, brief outage (up to 2–3 hours):

- During **vegetation** — virtually no consequences
- During **flowering** — minimal stress, provided the dark period is not interrupted

For repeated or prolonged outages:

- Slowed growth
- Hormonal stress
- Risk of male flowers (hermaphroditism)
- Reduced yield
- In severe cases — plant death (especially if ventilation is also lost)

### What's More Critical: Light or Ventilation?

When the power goes out, both light and ventilation stop. In an enclosed box, this means:

- Rising temperature (if the lamp was running) or dropping temperature (in winter)
- Humidity buildup
- CO₂ depletion
- Risk of mold

Therefore, an emergency system should provide minimal ventilation or at least air circulation.

## Solution Options

### 1. UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)

A UPS is the most convenient solution for short-term outages.

**Best suited for:**

- Keeping a LED fixture running for 30–120 minutes
- Keeping a fan running
- Automatic switchover without your intervention

**How to calculate runtime:**

**Runtime (hours) = UPS capacity (Wh) / Load wattage (W)**

Example: A UPS with a 500 Wh battery, a 100 W LED fixture, and a 30 W fan:
500 / 130 = 3.8 hours

**Recommendations:**

- For LED up to 200 W — a UPS rated at 1000 VA or higher (600–700 Wh)
- Choose a UPS with pure sine wave output — this is important for LED drivers
- A UPS is **not suitable for HPS/MH** — the startup current of gas-discharge lamps can damage the inverter

**Cons:** High cost for powerful models, limited runtime, batteries need replacing every 2–3 years.

### 2. Battery + Inverter

For longer backup, you can build a system based on a car or deep-cycle battery.

**Components:**

- 12 V battery (automotive 60–100 Ah, or deep-cycle/gel)
- 12 V to 120/220 V inverter (pure sine wave, wattage with margin)
- Automatic charger
- Automatic transfer switch (ATS) — optional

**Runtime calculation:**

**Runtime (hours) = Capacity (Ah) x Voltage (V) x 0.8 / Load wattage (W)**

The 0.8 factor accounts for inverter efficiency and incomplete discharge.

Example: A 100 Ah 12 V battery with a 100 W load:
100 x 12 x 0.8 / 100 = 9.6 hours

**Pros:** Large capacity, scalable, relatively affordable.

**Cons:** Bulky, requires maintenance, lead-acid batteries emit gases during charging (ventilation needed).

### 3. Power Bank + LED Strip (Minimal Solution)

The simplest and cheapest solution for maintaining the basic photoperiod.

**What you need:**

- Power bank 20,000–30,000 mAh with USB output
- 5 V USB LED strip in warm or neutral white
- USB cable

**Calculation:**

A 20,000 mAh power bank at 5 V = 100 Wh (realistically ~70 Wh accounting for losses).

5 W LED strip: 70 / 5 = 14 hours of runtime.

10 W LED strip: 70 / 10 = 7 hours.

**Pros:** Minimal cost, compact, simple, portable.

**Cons:** Very low light intensity; suitable only for maintaining the photoperiod, not for productive photosynthesis.

### 4. Portable Power Station

Modern portable power stations (EcoFlow, Jackery, Bluetti, etc.) are essentially large lithium-ion batteries with a built-in inverter.

**Specifications:**

- Capacity: 300 to 3,000+ Wh
- Outputs: 120/220 V AC, USB, 12 V DC
- Pure sine wave
- Automatic switchover (UPS mode on some models)

**Example:** A 1,000 Wh portable station with a 150 W LED + 30 W fan:
1,000 x 0.85 / 180 = 4.7 hours (0.85 = inverter efficiency)

**Pros:** Versatility, safety, pure sine wave, portability, silent operation.

**Cons:** High cost (starting from $300+ for decent capacity).

## DIY Solutions

### Emergency 12 V LED Panel

If you have some electronics knowledge, you can build an emergency panel that runs directly from a 12 V battery without an inverter (this improves efficiency).

**Components:**

- 12 V LED strips or modules (20–50 W total)
- 12 V automotive battery, 60 Ah
- Switching relay
- Wires, fuses

**Runtime:** 60 x 12 x 0.8 / 30 = 19.2 hours at a 30 W load

Such a system provides minimal but sufficient illumination to maintain the photoperiod for up to a full day.

### Candle Emergency Light

Some growers use candles in emergencies. This is an **extremely inadvisable** option:

- Fire hazard in an enclosed box
- Produces CO₂ and soot
- Negligible intensity (approximately 12 lumens from a single candle)
- Uncontrolled heat

Do not use candles if any alternative exists.

## Minimum Illumination for Maintaining the Photoperiod

Full photosynthesis is not possible with emergency lighting, but maintaining the photoperiod is entirely feasible. The plant does not need full lamp power to "know" it is daytime.

### Threshold Values

- **Minimum PPFD for detecting "daytime"** — 1 to 5 umol/s/m² (varies by source)
- **Minimum illuminance** — 50 to 200 lx (depends on plant species)
- **Recommended minimum for emergency mode** — 100–500 lx (5–25 umol/s/m²)

This means that even a low-wattage LED strip or desk lamp can maintain the photoperiod and prevent stress caused by light schedule disruptions.

### What's Needed for the Emergency Minimum

To maintain the photoperiod in a 60x60 cm box:

| Source | Wattage | Illuminance | Runtime from 20 Ah power bank |
|---|---|---|---|
| USB LED strip 5 V | 3–5 W | 200–500 lx | 14–24 hours |
| 12 V LED lamp | 5–10 W | 500–2,000 lx | 7–14 hours |
| LED flashlight | 1–3 W | 100–300 lx | 24–48 hours |

## Preparation Recommendations

### Emergency Readiness Checklist

- Determine how often you experience power outages and their typical duration
- Choose the appropriate solution based on your budget and outage duration
- Test your system before you actually need it — simulate an outage
- Charge your batteries/power bank and check them monthly
- Set up automatic switchover (if using a UPS or ATS relay)
- Don't forget about ventilation — at minimum, open the box during an outage

### Priorities During an Outage

1. **Ventilation** — if the box is closed and the lamp is off, temperature and humidity can reach critical levels. Open the box or ensure air circulation.
2. **Photoperiod** — maintain minimal illumination during the "daytime" phase.
3. **Light intensity** — the least critical parameter. Plants will survive several hours of dim light without serious consequences.

### What to Do During a Prolonged Outage (Over 24 Hours)

- Provide minimal light for at least 12–14 hours per day
- Open the box for ventilation
- Reduce watering — without light, plants consume less water
- Consider temporarily moving plants to a window (if safe to do so)
- After power is restored — gradually return plants to their normal schedule

Emergency lighting is insurance that can save months of your work. Invest a little time and money in preparation, and a sudden power outage won't be a catastrophe for your grow.
