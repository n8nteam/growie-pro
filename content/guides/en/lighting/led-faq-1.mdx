# LED Lighting FAQ

LED lighting has become the standard in home horticulture, but there are still many questions, myths, and misconceptions surrounding LED technology. This section collects answers to the most common questions beginner growers have about LEDs.

## How Many Watts of LED Per Square Meter?

This is the most frequent question, and the answer depends on the type of LEDs and the growth stage.

Approximate wattage values per square meter:

| Stage | Minimum | Optimum | Maximum |
|---|---|---|---|
| Seedlings/clones | 100 W/m² | 150 W/m² | 200 W/m² |
| Vegetative growth | 150 W/m² | 250 W/m² | 350 W/m² |
| Flowering | 250 W/m² | 400 W/m² | 600 W/m² |

These values are for quality white LEDs (Samsung LM301B/H, Osram, and equivalents) with an efficiency of 2.0–2.5 µmol/J. For cheap LEDs with low efficiency, the wattage needs to be increased.

A more precise metric is PPFD (photosynthetic photon flux density):

- Seedlings: 150–300 µmol/m²/s
- Vegetative growth: 300–600 µmol/m²/s
- Flowering: 600–1000 µmol/m²/s

PPFD is measured using specialized quantum sensors (PAR meters), but they are expensive. A budget alternative is smartphone apps (Photone, Korona), which provide approximate values.

## Which Spectrum Is Best for Plants?

Plants use light in the 400–700 nm range (photosynthetically active radiation, PAR). However, not all wavelengths are equally useful:

### Blue Light (400–500 nm)

- Stimulates vegetative growth
- Promotes compact growth (prevents stretching)
- Affects leaf formation and stomatal opening
- Especially important in the first weeks of life

### Green Light (500–600 nm)

- Was long considered useless for plants — this is a myth
- Penetrates deeper into the canopy, illuminating lower leaf layers
- Participates in photosynthesis, though less efficiently than red and blue
- Important for uniform development of the entire plant

### Red Light (600–700 nm)

- Most efficient for photosynthesis (chlorophyll absorption peak at 660 nm)
- Stimulates flowering and fruiting
- Affects stem elongation

### Far Red (700–780 nm)

- Technically outside PAR but plays an important role
- Affects the plant's phytochrome system (Pfr/Pr ratio)
- Accelerates the transition to flowering
- Increases overall leaf area

## Full Spectrum or Red-Blue?

This is one of the most debated questions in horticulture.

### Red-Blue (Blurple) Fixtures

Early LED grow lights used a combination of red (660 nm) and blue (450 nm) LEDs, creating the characteristic purple glow.

Pros:

- Theoretically maximum efficiency (light only at wavelengths absorbed by chlorophyll)
- Were justified when LEDs were expensive — every photon had to be "useful"

Cons:

- Absence of green light means uneven canopy illumination
- Visual plant diagnosis is difficult (impossible to see the true color of leaves)
- Modern research has shown that green light is also used in photosynthesis
- Plants under blurple light often develop worse than under full spectrum

### Full Spectrum (White Light)

Modern white LEDs (3000–4000 K) emit light across the entire visible range, with varying proportions of wavelengths depending on the color temperature.

Pros:

- More natural plant development
- Green light penetrates into the canopy
- Convenient visual diagnostics
- Modern white LEDs have high efficiency (2.5+ µmol/J)

Cons:

- Some energy goes to green and yellow light, less efficient for photosynthesis (but still used by plants)

Recommendation: for most growers, full-spectrum white LEDs at 3000–3500 K are the optimal choice. Some manufacturers add dedicated red diodes (660 nm) and far red (730 nm) to enhance the spectrum.

## Are Lenses Needed for LED Fixtures?

Lenses (secondary optics) are installed on LEDs to focus the light output.

### When Lenses Are Needed

- Hanging height above 50 cm
- Light needs to be concentrated on a specific area
- Using individual high-power LEDs (COBs) at great height

### When Lenses Are Not Needed

- Quantum boards (SMD LED arrays) — they already provide uniform coverage thanks to the large number of sources
- Hanging height under 30–40 cm
- Grow box has reflective walls (mylar, white paint)

### Lens Angles

- 60° — for high hanging, concentrated beam
- 90° — universal option
- 120° — for low hanging, wide coverage

In most modern grow boxes with quantum boards, lenses are not used.

## How to Determine the Actual Wattage of an LED Fixture?

Many manufacturers, especially on marketplaces, state inflated wattages. Typical deception methods:

- **"Equivalent wattage"**: a 100 W LED "replaces a 400 W HPS" — the box says 400 W
- **Maximum LED wattage**: 100 LEDs at 3 W each = "300 W," though they actually run at 1 W each
- **Driver wattage**: the power supply capacity is listed, not the fixture's consumption

How to determine actual wattage:

- Measure with a watt meter (the most reliable method)
- Check the driver specifications (output current × output voltage = wattage)
- Look for reviews and tests from independent sources
- Reliable manufacturers always state the actual power consumption

## Can You Build an LED Fixture Yourself?

Yes, and it is one of the best ways to get maximum efficiency for a reasonable price.

To build a DIY LED fixture, you will need:

- **LEDs or LED strips**: Samsung LM301B/H, Bridgelux EB Gen2, and similar
- **Driver (power supply)**: Mean Well HLG or ELG series — the industry standard
- **Heat sink**: aluminum profile or plate for heat dissipation
- **Wires, connectors, mounting hardware**
- **Soldering iron** (for SMD strips) or holders (for COBs)

DIY advantages:

- Cost is 30–50% lower than a comparable ready-made fixture
- Full control over spectrum and wattage
- Repairability and upgradeability
- Educational experience

Risks:

- Calculation errors can lead to overheating and LED failure
- Working with electricity requires basic knowledge and caution
- Low-quality components (counterfeit LEDs) will nullify your efforts

## Why Do Cheap LED Fixtures Fail to Perform?

Typical problems with budget LED fixtures from marketplaces:

- **Low-quality LEDs**: diodes with 0.5–1.0 µmol/J efficiency instead of 2.0+ for quality ones
- **Inflated wattage**: actual consumption 2–5 times below advertised
- **Suboptimal spectrum**: useless wavelengths, gaps in the red region
- **Poor cooling**: LEDs overheat and degrade rapidly
- **Cheap drivers**: unstable current, high ripple, short lifespan
- **No quality control**: parameter variation, defective diodes

The result is that a fixture costing very little with "1000 W" claimed actually outputs 30–50 watts of light with poor spectrum and efficiency lower than a CFL.

## What Is LED Binning?

Binning is the process of sorting LEDs by parameters after manufacturing.

Even on a single production line, LEDs have varying characteristics:

- Luminous flux (brightness)
- Forward voltage
- Color temperature
- Wavelength (for colored diodes)

The manufacturer measures each LED and sorts them into "bins" — groups with similar parameters. The best bins cost more.

For growers, binning matters for the following reasons:

- LEDs from the same bin provide uniform illumination
- A high luminous flux bin means a more efficient diode
- Quality fixture manufacturers use top bins
- Cheap manufacturers buy lower bins or unsorted diodes

Example: Samsung LM301B has bins from S6 (brightest) to S1 (least bright). The luminous flux difference between S6 and S1 can be 15–20%.

## Conclusion

LED lighting is a technology that, when used correctly, delivers the best results in home horticulture. The key to success is understanding real specifications, choosing quality components, and properly calculating the wattage for your area. Do not trust marketing claims, verify actual parameters, and choose LEDs from proven manufacturers.
