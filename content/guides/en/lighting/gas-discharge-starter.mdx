# Connecting Gas Discharge Lamps via an Ignitor

The ignitor is a key component in the wiring of high-intensity discharge lamps. Without it, an HPS or MH lamp simply will not ignite: ionizing the gas environment inside the bulb requires a brief high-voltage pulse, which the ignitor generates. In this article, we will examine ignitor types, wiring diagrams, and troubleshooting in detail.

## What Is an Ignitor and How Does It Work

An ignitor is an electronic device that generates a series of high-voltage pulses ranging from 2 to 5 kV. These pulses are applied to the lamp electrodes, causing a breakdown of the gas environment, after which an arc discharge forms. The choke (ballast) then limits the discharge current to the operating level.

The ignitor works by charging a capacitor through a resistor, followed by a rapid discharge through a pulse transformer. Pulses are generated at a frequency of several hertz until the lamp ignites. Once the discharge stabilizes, the voltage across the lamp drops below the ignitor's triggering threshold, and it automatically stops generating pulses.

## Types of Ignitors

### Two-Terminal Ignitors (Parallel Connection)

A two-terminal ignitor has two leads and is connected in parallel with the lamp. This is the simplest design.

Characteristics:

- Leads are labeled L (lamp) and N (neutral)
- Connected directly to the lamp socket terminals
- The high-voltage pulse passes through the entire circuit, including the choke winding
- Lower cost than three-terminal ignitors

Disadvantages of parallel connection:

- High-voltage pulses pass through the choke winding, gradually destroying inter-turn insulation
- Higher level of radio interference
- Reduced choke lifespan
- Strongly not recommended for lamps above 400 W

### Three-Terminal Ignitors (Series Connection)

A three-terminal ignitor is installed between the choke and the lamp and has three terminals:

- **B (Ballast)** — input from the choke
- **L (Lamp)** — output to the lamp
- **N (Neutral)** — common/neutral wire

Advantages of series connection:

- The high-voltage pulse is applied only to the section from the ignitor to the lamp and does not pass through the choke
- Extended choke lifespan
- Lower level of radio interference
- More reliable and safer circuit
- Recommended for lamps of any wattage

## Wiring Diagrams with an Ignitor

### Diagram with Two-Terminal Ignitor

```
Live (L) ──> [Choke] ──> Socket (contact 1) ──┐
                                                 ├── [2-terminal ignitor]
Neutral (N) ────────────> Socket (contact 2) ──┘
```

Sequence:

1. The live wire is fed to the choke input
2. The choke output goes to one contact of the lamp socket
3. The neutral wire goes to the second socket contact
4. The ignitor is connected in parallel with the socket — to both of its contacts

### Diagram with Three-Terminal Ignitor

```
Live (L) ──> [Choke] ──> Ignitor (B) ── Ignitor (L) ──> Socket (contact 1)
Neutral (N) ────────────> Ignitor (N) ──────────────> Socket (contact 2)
```

Sequence:

1. The live wire is fed to the choke input
2. The choke output connects to terminal B on the ignitor
3. Terminal L on the ignitor connects to the center contact of the socket
4. The neutral wire connects to terminal N on the ignitor and to the side contact of the socket

Important notes:

- The wire from ignitor terminal L to the socket should be as short as possible (no more than 1.5 m)
- This wire must be rated for voltages up to 5 kV or routed separately from other wires
- Do not swap terminals B and L — this will send the pulse through the choke

## Electronic Ballast vs Magnetic Choke + Ignitor

A comparison of two approaches to connecting gas discharge lamps:

| Parameter | Magnetic Choke + Ignitor | Electronic Ballast |
|---|---|---|
| Cost | Low | Higher |
| Weight | 4–7 kg | 1–3 kg |
| Power losses | 10–15% | 5–8% |
| Noise (hum) | Yes | No |
| Heat output | Significant | Moderate |
| Lifespan | 10+ years | 5–10 years |
| Soft start | No | Yes |
| Dimming | Not possible | In some models |
| Power switching | No | In some models |
| Repairability | High | Low |
| Short-circuit protection | No (breaker needed) | Built-in |

### When to Choose a Magnetic Choke

- Limited budget
- Maximum reliability and longevity needed
- You have electrical wiring skills
- The lamp is used at full power without the need for dimming

### When to Choose an Electronic Ballast

- Easy connection is important
- Dimming or power switching is needed
- Silent operation is critical
- The grow box is located in a living space

## Electronic Ballasts

Modern electronic ballasts combine the functions of a choke, ignitor, and capacitor. They operate at high frequency (20–50 kHz) instead of the mains 50 Hz, which provides several advantages.

### How Electronic Ballasts Work

1. An input rectifier converts 220 V AC to DC
2. A power factor corrector brings cos phi close to 1
3. An inverter converts DC to high-frequency AC
4. A control circuit generates starting pulses and stabilizes the operating current

### Popular Electronic Ballast Models for Grow Boxes

- **600 W electronic ballast with dimming**: supports 50%, 75%, 100%, and SuperLumen (110%) modes. Allows using one lamp at different growth stages
- **Universal electronic ballasts**: work with both HPS and MH lamps, switching lamp type with a single button
- **Digital electronic ballasts with display**: show power consumption, lamp hours, and temperature

### Connecting an Electronic Ballast

Connecting an electronic ballast is significantly simpler than assembling a magnetic choke setup:

1. Connect the input cable (live, neutral, ground) to the electronic ballast input terminals
2. Connect the output cable from the electronic ballast output terminals to the lamp socket
3. Install the lamp and turn on the power

No additional components (ignitor, capacitor) are required.

## Troubleshooting

### Lamp Does Not Ignite

Possible causes and solutions:

- **Faulty ignitor**: check if you can hear characteristic clicking when turning on. If silent — the ignitor has failed. Replace it
- **Swapped ignitor terminals**: verify the correct connection of B, L, N
- **Faulty lamp**: try replacing the lamp with a known working one
- **Open circuit in the choke**: measure the winding resistance with a multimeter. For a 400 W choke, it should be 10–30 ohms. Infinity means an open circuit
- **Wire to lamp too long**: shorten the wire from the ignitor to the socket

### Lamp Ignites Then Goes Out

- **Worn lamp**: a degraded lamp requires higher voltage to sustain the discharge. Replace the lamp
- **Mismatched choke wattage**: check the markings on the choke and lamp
- **Low mains voltage**: measure voltage at the outlet. If below 200 V, the lamp may operate unstably
- **Poor socket contact**: inspect and clean the contacts

### Choke Overheating

- A magnetic choke temperature can reach 100–110°C — this is the upper limit of normal
- If the choke is so hot you cannot touch it for more than a second, it is overheating
- Causes: inter-turn short circuit, wattage mismatch, poor ventilation
- An overheating choke should be replaced

### Loud Choke Hum

- Moderate humming at 100 Hz is normal for a magnetic choke
- Excessive hum may indicate loosened core laminations
- Placing the choke on a vibration-dampening pad (rubber, foam) reduces vibration
- If the hum is unbearable, consider switching to an electronic ballast

### Ignitor Clicks But Lamp Does Not Ignite

- Check the lamp — it may be faulty
- Check the length and integrity of the wire from the ignitor to the socket
- Make sure the socket contacts are clean and provide good connection
- If the lamp is new and wires are short — the ignitor may be faulty (insufficient pulse voltage)

## Safety Tips

- Perform all wiring work only with the power disconnected
- The capacitor can retain a charge after disconnection — discharge it before working
- After replacing an ignitor, always verify the wiring before turning on
- Use an appropriately rated circuit breaker on the power supply line
- When working with electronic ballasts, do not open the housing — high-voltage components are present inside

## Conclusion

Choosing the ignitor type and connection method for a gas discharge lamp is an important decision that affects safety, reliability, and equipment lifespan. For new installations, using a three-terminal ignitor or switching to an electronic ballast is recommended. Regardless of the approach, follow electrical safety rules, use quality components, and do not neglect grounding.
