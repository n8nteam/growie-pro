# Light and Lighting Equipment

The lamp or LED panel is the foundation of grow box lighting, but without the right supporting equipment, even the best light source will not reach its full potential. Timers, hangers, cables, and measuring instruments all form a system where every component matters. Let us cover each one in detail.

## Timers

A timer is a mandatory component. It automatically turns the light on and off on schedule, ensuring a stable photoperiod. Manual switching is unreliable: forget to turn the light on or off, and the schedule is broken -- which can stress the plants.

### Mechanical Timers

The simplest option: a dial marked in 15- or 30-minute increments, with plastic tabs that are pushed down to set the on-time.

Advantages:

- Low price
- No setup required -- intuitive to use
- Do not reset during brief power outages (spring-driven mechanism)

Disadvantages:

- Accuracy of plus/minus 5-10 minutes
- Mechanical wear -- contacts burn out after 1-2 years
- Maximum load is usually 3500W (16A), but cheap ones actually handle only 8-10A
- Audible ticking

### Electronic Timers

Digital programmable timers with an LCD display. They allow up to 8-20 on/off programs per day.

Advantages:

- Accuracy of plus/minus 1 second
- Multiple programs
- Minimum interval of 1 minute
- Silent operation

Disadvantages:

- Higher price
- May lose time setting during power outages (unless battery-backed)
- Setup is more involved -- you need to learn the buttons

### Choosing a Timer

- For a standard 18/6 or 12/12 schedule, a mechanical timer is sufficient
- Make sure the timer is rated for your fixture's load (with a 20% margin)
- For HPS with a magnetic ballast (coil), choose a timer with extra power headroom -- inrush current can be 2-3 times the operating current
- For electronic ballasts and LEDs, inrush current is negligible

## Hangers

### Spring Hangers (Easy Rollers)

A spring-loaded reel with a cable, similar to a retractable badge holder. Allows smooth height adjustment of the fixture. Rated for 5-10 kg depending on the model.

- Easy to adjust with one hand
- Spring may weaken over time

### Chain with Carabiners

Fine-link steel chain (2-3 mm). The carabiner hooks into the desired link. Step adjustment at 15-25 mm increments.

- Reliable, high load capacity
- Less convenient to adjust

### Steel Cable with Clamps

2-3 mm cable with screw clamps. Adjustment is stepless -- slide the cable through the clamp.

- Suitable for heavy fixtures (15+ kg)
- Requires strong mounting points on the box ceiling

## Cables and Connectors

### Power Cables

- **Flexible cord** -- the main cable for connecting fixtures. Cross-section: 2x0.75 mm2 for loads up to 200W, 2x1.5 mm2 for up to 500W, 3x1.5 mm2 (with ground) for high-power setups
- **Heat-resistant wire** (rated to 180 degrees C) -- used inside fixtures near hot lamps
- **Light-duty cord** -- for loads up to 100W (LED bulbs)

### Connectors

- **IEC C13/C14** -- standard computer connector, used on many electronic ballasts. Convenient for quick connect/disconnect
- **Standard plug and outlet** -- the universal option. Use quality grounded plugs for high-power loads
- **Terminal blocks** -- for permanent connections inside junction boxes

### Safety

- All connections should be inside junction boxes, not hanging freely
- Wires must not touch hot lamps or reflectors
- Use cable channels or corrugated conduit to route wires along box walls

## Dimmers

A dimmer allows smooth adjustment of fixture power (and therefore brightness).

### For LED Panels

Many grow lights have a built-in dimmer -- a potentiometer on the driver. Allows reducing power from 100% down to 10-30%. This is useful:

- During the seedling stage -- reduce to 40-50%
- In hot weather -- reduce power instead of raising the lamp
- To save electricity when full power is not needed

### For HPS with Electronic Ballast

Electronic ballasts for HPS often have a stepped dimmer: 50%, 75%, 100%, sometimes 110% (Super Lumen). Switched via a physical toggle on the housing.

### For HPS with Magnetic Ballast

A magnetic ballast does not support dimming. To change the power, you must swap the lamp for a lower-wattage one (e.g., 250W HPS in a 400W ballast -- not all models allow this; check compatibility).

### Household Dimmers

Standard household dimmers designed for incandescent bulbs (triac-based) are not compatible with HPS, electronic ballasts, or most LED drivers. They are designed for resistive loads and can damage electronic circuits.

## Measuring Instruments

### Lux Meter

Measures illuminance in lux. Available as a standalone device or as a smartphone app (free but less accurate).

Limitations: a lux meter weighs the spectrum by human eye sensitivity. For HPS lamps (yellow spectrum), readings are inflated; for red-blue LEDs, readings are understated. Still, a lux meter is useful for assessing light uniformity and comparing reflectors.

Approximate conversion factors (lux to PPFD):

| Source | 1000 lux approx. PPFD |
|---|---|
| Sunlight / full-spectrum LED | ~18 umol/m2/s |
| HPS | ~13 umol/m2/s |
| MH | ~16 umol/m2/s |
| CFL 6400K | ~15 umol/m2/s |
| Red-blue LED | ~30-40 umol/m2/s |

### PAR Meter (Quantum Sensor)

Measures PPFD directly in umol/m2/s. Professional models (Apogee MQ-500, LI-COR LI-190R) are expensive. For hobbyist use, budget options exist: Photone (smartphone app, plus/minus 10% accuracy when calibrated), and affordable standalone PAR meters.

### Watt Meter

Measures actual power consumption. Plugs in between the fixture plug and the wall outlet. Allows you to:

- Verify actual wattage (cheap LEDs often overstate it)
- Track consumption over a cycle
- Calculate electricity costs

## Thermal Protection

### Thermostat (Thermal Relay)

A device that disconnects the load when a set temperature is exceeded. Wired in series with the timer. If the box temperature rises above the threshold (typically 35 degrees C), the light shuts off, preventing heat stress.

Types:

- **Mechanical bimetallic** -- simple, reliable, accuracy plus/minus 2 degrees C
- **Electronic with sensor** -- accuracy plus/minus 0.5 degrees C, programmable

### Fuses and Circuit Breakers

The grow box power line should be protected by:

- A circuit breaker in the panel (16A for loads up to 3.5 kW)
- A residual current device (RCD/GFCI) -- protects against electric shock from leakage

## Automation

### Basic Level

- Timer for photoperiod control
- Thermostat for emergency shutdown
- This is sufficient for most growers

### Intermediate Level

- Climate controller (Inkbird, STC-1000) -- temperature-based on/off control of ventilation and lighting
- Programmable relay -- multiple channels for different fixtures (e.g., independent HPS and CFL control)
- Wi-Fi outlets and smart relays -- smartphone control, logging, notifications

### Advanced Level

- Full-featured grow box controllers (TrolMaster, Autopilot) -- unified control of light, ventilation, CO2, and irrigation
- DIY systems based on Arduino/ESP32 with light, temperature, and humidity sensors
- Automatic lamp height adjustment based on PAR sensor readings (exotic but it exists)

## What to Buy First

If you are just starting out and the budget is tight, prioritize like this:

1. **Timer** -- essential. A basic mechanical timer does the job
2. **Hangers** -- a pair of spring hangers saves frustration when adjusting height
3. **Wire and plug** -- quality wire of the right gauge
4. **Lux meter** (phone app) -- free. Lets you evaluate uniformity and compare settings
5. **Watt meter** -- useful but not critical at the start

The minimum set of supporting equipment costs very little. That money pays for itself through a stable lighting schedule, easy adjustment, and safe operation.
