# Building a Simple DIY Light Fixture

You do not always need to buy a ready-made fixture. For a starter grow with a CFL or LED bulb, a simple hanging fixture built from common components does the job. It takes 30-60 minutes and costs very little.

## What You Will Need

### Core Materials

- **E27 socket** (for lamps up to 100W) or **E40 socket** (for high-wattage CFLs 105-300W and HPS) -- ceramic is preferred over plastic as it withstands heat
- **2x0.75 mm2 cable** (for lamps up to 200W) or **2x1.5 mm2** (for high-wattage lamps) -- length 1.5-2.5 m
- **Plug** with or without ground (depending on the design)
- **Suspension hardware** -- chain, cable, or rope with carabiners

### Additional

- Electrical tape or heat-shrink tubing
- Ceiling hook for the grow box
- Spring hangers (optional, for height adjustment)

### Tools

- Phillips and flathead screwdrivers
- Wire stripping knife (or wire stripper)
- Pliers

## Electrical Safety

Before you begin assembly, follow these basic electrical safety rules:

- **Never work with the power on** -- assemble the fixture with the plug disconnected
- **Use wire of adequate gauge** -- thin wire overheats and can catch fire
- **All connections must be secure** -- a loose contact arcs and heats up
- **Insulate exposed sections** -- heat-shrink tubing is more reliable than electrical tape
- **Do not exceed the socket's rated wattage** -- the maximum lamp wattage is marked on the socket
- **Use ceramic sockets for hot lamps** -- plastic sockets melt from HPS and high-wattage CFL heat
- **Grounding** -- if the fixture body is metal, it must be grounded

### Wire Gauge Table

| Lamp Wattage | Current (at 220V) | Minimum Wire Gauge |
|---|---|---|
| Up to 100W | 0.45 A | 0.5 mm2 |
| 100-200W | 0.9 A | 0.75 mm2 |
| 200-500W | 2.3 A | 1.5 mm2 |
| 500-1000W | 4.5 A | 2.5 mm2 |

## Option 1: Simple Hanging Fixture for CFL

### Assembly

1. **Prepare the wire.** Cut the needed length (from plug to hanging point plus 30 cm extra). Strip both ends by 8-10 mm.

2. **Wire the plug.** Open the plug, insert the stripped wire ends into the terminals, and tighten the screws. Make sure the wire is firmly held by the plug's strain relief. Close the plug.

3. **Wire the socket.** Open the E27 socket. A ceramic socket has two internal contacts -- the center contact (live) and the side contact (neutral). Attach the wire conductors to the terminals and tighten. If the wire is stranded, twist the strands tightly before clamping, or use ferrule terminals.

4. **Reassemble the socket.** Screw the socket body back together. Make sure the wire exits through the top hole and is not pinched anywhere.

5. **Set up the suspension.** The wire must not bear the weight of the lamp -- that is dangerous. Use a separate suspension:
   - Thread a chain through the ring on the socket (if present)
   - Or mount the socket on a bracket/bar and hang the bar from chains

6. **Test.** Visually inspect all connections. Screw in the lamp. Plug in. The lamp should light up without arcing, flickering, or unusual sounds.

### Reflector

For a CFL, the simplest reflector is an aluminum plate or pot lid with a hole in the center. Slide the reflector onto the socket above the lamp. This redirects upward-going light downward, improving efficiency by 20-30%.

## Option 2: Fixture for an E27 LED Bulb

LED bulbs run much cooler than CFLs and HPS, so the socket and mounting requirements are simpler.

### Assembly

The process is the same as Option 1, but with some differences:

- A plastic E27 socket is sufficient
- 2x0.75 mm2 wire works for any household LED bulb
- A reflector is less critical since LED bulbs direct light predominantly downward (120-180 degree beam angle)

### Multi-Socket Fixture

For multiple LED bulbs, you can build a bar with several sockets:

1. Take a wooden strip or aluminum profile, 40-60 cm long
2. Mount 3-5 E27 sockets at 10-15 cm intervals
3. Wire all sockets in parallel with a single cable
4. Hang the bar from two cables

Such a fixture with five 20W LED bulbs (100W total) provides even coverage over a 40x60 cm area.

## Option 3: Fixture for a High-Wattage E40 CFL

High-wattage CFLs (105-300W) use the E40 base and weigh 400-800 g. This demands a more robust approach.

### Key Points

- E40 socket must be ceramic -- high-wattage CFLs generate significant heat at the base
- The suspension must handle the lamp weight (up to 1 kg including the socket)
- Wire minimum 2x1.0 mm2

### Assembly

1. Mount the ceramic E40 socket on a metal plate (100x100 mm, aluminum or steel 1-2 mm thick)
2. Drill a socket hole in the plate and 4 corner holes for suspension cables
3. Wire the socket
4. Hang the plate from four cables or chains to the box ceiling
5. Install a reflector above the socket (an aluminum cone or "cap")

## Suspension and Height Adjustment

### Spring Hangers (Easy Rollers)

The most convenient option -- spring-loaded reels with a cable and lock, working like a retractable badge holder. They let you raise and lower the fixture with one hand. Available at grow shops and hardware stores.

### Chain with Carabiners

Budget option -- fine-link steel chain (2-3 mm). The carabiner hooks into the desired link, providing step adjustment in 2-3 cm increments. You need two chain lengths -- one for each side of the fixture.

### Rope with Knots

The simplest option -- 3-4 mm nylon rope. Tie knots every 5 cm and fix them on hooks. The downside is less precise adjustment, and nylon can melt from lamp heat if positioned too close.

## Testing the Finished Fixture

After assembly, perform a check:

- All contacts are tight and do not shift when the wire is gently tugged
- No exposed wire sections
- The socket is firmly mounted and does not wobble
- The suspension holds the lamp weight with margin (test-hang double the weight)
- The lamp turns on and runs steadily for 10 minutes
- Socket and wire temperature after 30 minutes of operation does not exceed 60 degrees C (a hand test -- if you can hold it for 3 seconds, the temperature is fine)

## What Not to Do

- Hang the fixture by the wire -- wire is not designed for mechanical load
- Use uninsulated splices -- fire hazard
- Install a lamp more powerful than the socket rating
- Use a plastic socket for HPS or high-wattage CFLs
- Place flammable materials (fabric, paper, polystyrene) within 30 cm of a hot lamp
- Run the fixture unattended until you are confident it is reliable (check every 2-3 hours during the first 24 hours)

A DIY fixture is simple, fast, and cheap. When electrical safety rules are followed, it will last through an entire grow cycle and beyond.
