# Fluorescent/Area: Coverage Calculation

One of the most common questions from beginner growers is: "How many lamps do I need?" For fluorescent lamps, this question is especially relevant because a single lamp will never cover a serious area. You need an array, and it must be properly calculated. This article covers formulas, standards, examples, and practical placement layouts.

## Basic Units of Measurement

Before crunching numbers, let's agree on the units:

- Lumen (lm) — the total luminous flux of a lamp as perceived by the human eye. Listed on the packaging.
- Lux (lx) — illuminance of a surface. 1 lx = 1 lm per 1 m². Measured with a lux meter.
- PPFD (umol/m2/s) — Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density. The number of PAR-range photons (400–700 nm) hitting one square meter per second. Measured with a PAR meter.
- PPF (umol/s) — the total Photosynthetic Photon Flux of a lamp.

For fluorescent lamps, the approximate conversion factor is: 1000 lx corresponds to roughly 14–16 umol/m2/s PPFD (varies with spectrum).

## Lighting Standards for Plants

Minimum and optimal illuminance values depend on the growth stage:

| Stage | Minimum (lux) | Optimal (lux) | Minimum (PPFD) | Optimal (PPFD) |
|-------|--------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Germination | 3,000 | 5,000–7,000 | 45 | 75–100 |
| Seedlings/clones | 5,000 | 7,000–10,000 | 75 | 100–150 |
| Vegetation | 15,000 | 25,000–35,000 | 200 | 350–500 |
| Flowering | 25,000 | 40,000–60,000 | 350 | 600–900 |

Important: achieving the optimal level (40,000+ lux) for flowering under fluorescent lamps is extremely difficult. A realistic target is 20,000–30,000 lux, which will produce acceptable though not maximal flowering.

## Formula for Calculating Lamp Count

### Basic Formula

Number of lamps = (Required illuminance x Area) / (Luminous flux per lamp x Utilization factor)

Where:

- Required illuminance — in lux (from the table above)
- Area — in square meters
- Luminous flux — in lumens (from the lamp packaging)
- Utilization factor — the fraction of light that actually reaches the plants

### Utilization Factor

This factor accounts for light losses and depends on the grow box construction:

- Reflective walls (Mylar, foil-backed insulation): 0.6–0.7
- Matte white walls: 0.5–0.6
- Dark or non-reflective walls: 0.3–0.4
- Open space (no walls): 0.3–0.35

For a typical grow box with reflective walls, use a factor of 0.65.

### Calculation Example

Task: calculate the number of T5 HO 54 W lamps for vegetation in a 60x60 cm area.

Given:

- Area: 0.6 x 0.6 = 0.36 m²
- Required illuminance: 25,000 lux (vegetation optimum)
- Luminous flux of T5 HO 54 W: 4450 lm
- Utilization factor: 0.65

Calculation: N = (25,000 x 0.36) / (4,450 x 0.65) = 9,000 / 2,892 = 3.1

Round up: 4 T5 HO 54 W lamps.

Total power: 4 x 54 = 216 W. Total flux: 4 x 4,450 = 17,800 lm. Calculated illuminance: 17,800 x 0.65 / 0.36 = 32,100 lux — more than enough for vegetation.

## Lumens per Square Meter for Different Stages

A convenient rule of thumb for lumens per area:

| Stage | lm/m² (minimum) | lm/m² (optimal) | Fluorescent W/m² (guideline) |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| Seedlings | 5,000 | 10,000 | 80–120 W/m² |
| Vegetation | 15,000 | 30,000 | 200–350 W/m² |
| Flowering | 25,000 | 50,000 | 350–500+ W/m² |

For flowering, the fluorescent wattage requirement per square meter reaches 500 W — this is the boundary of practicality for fluorescent lamps. For areas over 0.5 m², it's more efficient to switch to HPS or LED for flowering.

## Configuration Examples

### 40x40 cm Area (0.16 m²) — Micro Grow

Option 1 — T5 HO:

- 2 T5 HO 24 W lamps (549 mm) + reflector
- Total power: 48 W
- Luminous flux: 2 x 2,000 = 4,000 lm
- Illuminance: 4,000 x 0.65 / 0.16 = 16,250 lux
- Sufficient for: vegetation (good), flowering (modest)

Option 2 — CFL:

- 1 CFL 85 W E40 (6500K) + 1 CFL 55 W E27 (2700K)
- Total power: 140 W
- Luminous flux: ~9,500 lm
- Illuminance: 9,500 x 0.65 / 0.16 = 38,600 lux
- Sufficient for: full cycle with good results

Option 3 — Combo:

- 2 T5 HO 24 W lamps on top + 2 CFL 23 W on the sides
- Total power: 94 W
- Good coverage from all angles for a single plant

### 60x60 cm Area (0.36 m²) — Standard Small Box

Option 1 — T5 HO panel:

- 4 T5 HO 54 W lamps (1149 mm)
- Total power: 216 W
- Luminous flux: 4 x 4,450 = 17,800 lm
- Illuminance: 17,800 x 0.65 / 0.36 = 32,100 lux
- Sufficient for: excellent vegetation, moderate flowering

Option 2 — T5 HO maximum:

- 6 T5 HO 54 W lamps
- Total power: 324 W
- Luminous flux: 26,700 lm
- Illuminance: 48,200 lux
- Sufficient for: full cycle with good results

Option 3 — CFL array:

- 3 CFL 85 W E40 (2 pcs 6500K + 1 pc 2700K for vegetation)
- Total power: 255 W
- Luminous flux: ~15,000 lm
- Illuminance: 27,100 lux
- Sufficient for: good vegetation, moderate flowering

### 80x80 cm Area (0.64 m²) — Fluorescent Practicality Limit

At this size, fluorescents become impractical, but if no other options exist:

- 8 T5 HO 54 W lamps
- Total power: 432 W
- Luminous flux: 35,600 lm
- Illuminance: 36,200 lux
- Borderline minimum for flowering, good for vegetation

At this area, a 250 W HPS or 200 W LED will deliver better results at lower consumption.

## Compensating for Brightness Drop-off at Edges

Fluorescent lamps are linear sources, and illuminance inevitably drops toward the edges of the area. There are several ways to compensate:

### Reflective Walls

The single most important factor. Quality reflective walls return up to 85–95% of incident light back to the plants.

Materials ranked by reflectance:

- Mirror Mylar: 92–97% reflectance
- Matte white paint: 85–90%
- Foil-backed insulation: 80–90%
- Aluminum foil (matte side out): 70–80%
- White fabric: 65–75%

Strongly discouraged: foil shiny side out — creates hot spots (uneven reflection); crumpled foil — scatters ineffectively.

### Overlapping Lamp Placement

Lamps should be positioned so that their light footprints overlap. For T5 HO, the optimal spacing between lamp centers is 8–12 cm. Greater spacing creates dark bands.

### Additional Side Lamps

CFL lamps of 23–30 W mounted vertically on the box walls significantly increase illuminance in the peripheral zone. Two CFLs on the sides add 20–30% to total PPFD at lower canopy levels.

### Plant Positioning

Rotating pots every 2–3 days (90–180° turn) ensures even development. Place taller plants toward the edges, shorter ones in the center under maximum light.

## Practical Placement Layouts

### Layout 1: Parallel Rows (for T5/T8)

Lamps arranged in parallel, horizontally. The classic layout for ready-made T5 panels.

For 60x60 cm — four T5 HO 54 W lamps spaced 15 cm apart:

- First lamp at 7.5 cm from the wall
- Second — 22.5 cm
- Third — 37.5 cm
- Fourth — 52.5 cm

This ensures uniform coverage with minimal dark zones. A reflector for each lamp (or a shared panel reflector) directs light downward.

### Layout 2: Grid (for CFLs)

CFLs arranged in a 2x2 or 3x3 grid for uniform coverage.

For 60x60 cm — four 55 W CFLs in a 2x2 pattern:

- Each lamp offset 15 cm from the nearest wall
- Distance between lamps: 30 cm
- Lamps oriented vertically (base up)

### Layout 3: Central + Peripheral

One powerful CFL (85–125 W) in the center + 4 low-wattage CFLs (23–30 W) at the corners. The central lamp provides the main light output, while the corner lamps fill the periphery and lower canopy levels.

### Layout 4: Multi-Level

For advanced growers — lamps at different heights. Upper tier (T5 or powerful CFLs) — main lighting. Lower tier (23 W CFLs on the walls) — supplemental lighting for lower branches. The upper tier rises as plants grow; the lower tier stays in place.

## Quick Selection Calculator

For quick selection without complex formulas, use these guidelines:

Watts per area rule (for fluorescents only):

- Seedlings: 80–120 actual watts per 0.1 m² (approximately 30x30 cm)
- Vegetation: 120–200 actual watts per 0.1 m²
- Flowering: 200–300 actual watts per 0.1 m²

T5 HO 54 W lamp count rule:

- 30x30 cm: 1–2 lamps
- 40x40 cm: 2–3 lamps
- 60x60 cm: 4–6 lamps
- 80x80 cm: 8+ lamps (better to switch lighting type)

CFL 85 W rule:

- 30x30 cm: 1 lamp
- 40x40 cm: 1–2 lamps
- 60x60 cm: 2–3 lamps
- 80x80 cm: not recommended

Lighting calculation isn't an exact science — it's a set of guidelines proven by practice. It's better to have a slight power surplus than a deficit. At the same time, remember that for fluorescent lamps, distance to plants is the critical factor: keep the lamps as close to the canopy as possible, and your calculation will pay off with maximum return from every watt.
