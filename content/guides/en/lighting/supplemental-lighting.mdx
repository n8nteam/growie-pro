# Supplemental Lighting

The main lamp provides top-down illumination, but in a real grow box the lower and side portions of plants receive significantly less light. Supplemental lighting compensates for this deficit and can substantially boost overall productivity without replacing the primary fixture.

## Why Supplemental Lighting Matters

Even the most powerful lamp illuminates the plant primarily from above. In practice:

- **Lower leaf layers** receive 3–10 times less light than the canopy top
- **The interior of the bush** is shaded by upper leaves
- **Side surfaces** receive almost no direct light from the overhead source
- **Corner plants** in large boxes may receive 30–50% less PPFD than center plants

Supplemental lighting addresses these issues and offers several advantages:

- Increase overall yield by 10–30% without replacing the main lamp
- More uniform bud development across all tiers
- Prevention of yellowing and die-off of lower leaves
- Ability to use specialized spectra for specific purposes (UV, far-red)

## Side Lighting

Side lighting involves placing additional light sources on the walls of the grow box, aimed at the sides of the plants.

### Which Lamps to Use

- **LED strips** (high-power, 5050 or COB) — compact, easy to mount, but relatively low intensity
- **Low-wattage LED bars** — more intense light, good coverage
- **23–42 W CFL** — a budget option, easy to position
- **T5 linear fluorescent tubes** — even light along the full length

### Side Lighting Placement

Optimal layout for a 60x60 cm box and larger:

- Mount light sources on 2–3 walls (the back wall can remain reflective)
- Mounting height — mid-canopy level (at 1/3 to 2/3 of the bush height)
- Aim the light horizontally, angled slightly downward
- Distance from lamp to nearest leaf — at least 5 cm for LED, 3 cm for CFL
- Total wattage of side lighting — 15–25% of the main light

### Effect on Plants

Side lighting stimulates the development of lateral shoots and lower buds. Plants receiving side light form a denser, more branched bush. The effect is especially noticeable when combined with training techniques (LST, SCROG).

## Inter-Canopy Lighting

Inter-canopy (intracanopy) lighting involves placing light sources inside the plant's canopy, between layers of branches.

### When It's Beneficial

- When growing tall plants without pruning
- When using the SOG (Sea of Green) method with dense planting
- When lower buds are significantly lagging in development

### Implementation

For inter-canopy lighting, use:

- **Thin LED bars** — the optimal choice; their narrow profile minimizes shading
- **LED strips on rigid profiles** — a budget alternative
- **Short T5 fluorescent tubes** — a classic option

Inter-canopy supplemental lighting typically accounts for 10–20% of the main lighting wattage. Position the sources horizontally at the level of the lower third of the canopy.

**Important:** Make sure leaves do not touch the lamps. Use protective covers or netting to maintain distance.

## UVB Supplemental Lighting

Ultraviolet radiation in the UVB range (280–315 nm) promotes the production of protective compounds in plants, including terpenes and flavonoids.

### Why Use UVB

- Increased trichome and secondary metabolite production
- More pronounced aroma and flavor
- Enhanced pest resistance
- More compact growth (UVB suppresses stretching)

### Which Lamps to Use

- **Reptile UVB lamps** — available at pet stores, 25–40 W. Models labeled 10.0 or T5 HO UVB.
- **Specialized UVB LEDs** — expensive but effective
- **T5 UVB fluorescent tubes** — the most common option

### UVB Usage Schedule

UVB supplemental lighting is applied **only during the flowering stage** on a limited schedule:

- Start with 15–30 minutes per day
- Gradually increase to 2–4 hours per day
- Maximum exposure — during the middle of the light period
- Distance from lamp to plants — 30–60 cm (depends on wattage)
- Discontinue 1–2 weeks before harvest (or continue until the very end — opinions vary)

**Caution:** UVB is hazardous to human eyes and skin. When working in the box with a UVB lamp on, wear protective glasses and avoid prolonged skin exposure.

## Red Supplemental Lighting for Flowering

Additional red light (620–680 nm) and far-red light (720–740 nm) have specific effects on plants during the flowering period.

### Red Light 660 nm

- Stimulates flowering and bud development
- Increases photosynthetic efficiency (chlorophyll A absorption peak)
- Accelerates maturation

Adding 660 nm red LED strips to the main white or HPS lighting can increase productivity by 5–15%.

### Far-Red 730 nm

Far-red light affects the plant's phytochrome system:

- **Emerson effect** — simultaneous exposure to red and far-red light increases photosynthetic efficiency by 30% beyond the sum of each individually
- **Accelerated transition to night mode** — 5–15 minutes of far-red at the end of the light period speeds up the plant's "sleep" response
- **Internode elongation** — excessive far-red causes stretching, so dose carefully

### Red Supplemental Lighting Application

- Red 660 nm LEDs — run throughout the light period alongside the main light
- Far-red 730 nm — turn on for 10–15 minutes after the main light switches off (to speed up the sleep response) or run during the day at minimum power
- Total wattage of red supplemental lighting — 5–10% of the main lighting

## Green Light for Working in the Dark

Green light (500–565 nm) deserves special mention. It has minimal impact on the plant's photoperiodic response, making it safe for working in the box during the dark period.

- Use a green LED flashlight or a green lamp up to 5 W
- Do not overdo it — even green light at high intensity can affect the photoperiod
- Limit time in the box under green light to 5–10 minutes

## Supplemental Lighting Placement Schemes

### Basic Scheme (Budget)

- Main light: LED QB or HPS overhead
- Supplemental: 2 x 23 W CFL on the sides at mid-plant height

### Intermediate Scheme

- Main light: LED QB overhead
- Side lighting: LED bars or LED strips on 2–3 walls
- Total supplemental wattage: 15–20% of main

### Advanced Scheme

- Main light: LED QB or LED bars overhead
- Side lighting: LED bars on 3–4 walls
- Inter-canopy lighting: thin LED bar inside the canopy
- UVB lamp: T5 UVB during flowering
- Far-red LED: for accelerating sleep response
- Total supplemental wattage: 20–30% of main

## Calculating Supplemental Lighting Wattage

General rule: supplemental lighting wattage is 15–30% of the main lighting.

| Main Light | Minimum Supplemental | Optimal Supplemental |
|---|---|---|
| 100 W LED | 15 W | 20–30 W |
| 200 W LED | 30 W | 40–60 W |
| 300 W LED | 45 W | 60–90 W |
| 400 W HPS | 60 W | 80–120 W |
| 600 W HPS | 90 W | 120–180 W |

## Practical Tips

- **Start small** — add a couple of CFLs on the sides and evaluate the results. If the difference is noticeable, expand the system.
- **Supplemental light does not replace the main light** — it complements it. Do not skimp on the main lamp expecting supplemental lighting to compensate.
- **Monitor temperature** — additional lamps add heat. Verify that your ventilation can handle it.
- **Use timers** — supplemental lights should turn on and off together with the main light (except far-red and UVB, which have their own schedules).
- **Mount lamps securely** — a lamp falling onto a plant can cause fire or burns.
- **Consider plant training** — a SCROG net combined with side lighting produces the best results by exposing lower tiers to light.
