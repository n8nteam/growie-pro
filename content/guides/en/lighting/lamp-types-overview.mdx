# Overview of Lamp Types

Choosing a lamp is one of the most important decisions when setting up a grow box. The type of light source affects energy consumption, heat output, spectral composition, and ultimately your growing results. Let's examine all the major lamp types used in indoor horticulture.

## Incandescent Bulbs

Let's start with what is categorically **not recommended**. Standard incandescent bulbs (including halogen) have extremely low efficiency — only about 5% of the energy consumed is converted to visible light. The remaining 95% is lost as heat.

**Why they are unsuitable:**

- Very low luminous efficacy — approximately 12–15 lm/W
- Excessive heat output
- Spectrum is shifted toward infrared and red, with virtually no blue light
- Extremely short lifespan (approximately 1,000 hours)
- High energy consumption with minimal benefit to plants

The only exception — halogen lamps can be used briefly as an emergency light source, but this is inefficient and dangerous due to intense heat.

## Fluorescent Lamps

Fluorescent lamps come in two main types used in growing.

### Linear Fluorescent Tubes (T5, T8)

Tubular fluorescent lamps are a budget-friendly option for beginners or for use as supplemental lighting.

- **Luminous efficacy:** 50–100 lm/W
- **Color temperature:** available from 2700 K to 6500 K
- **Lifespan:** 6,000–20,000 hours
- **Heat output:** moderate

T5 tubes (16 mm diameter) are more efficient and compact than T8 tubes (26 mm). T5 lamps with electronic ballasts are recommended for grow boxes.

**Pros:** low cost, low heat output, even light distribution, wide availability, safety.

**Cons:** low light intensity, suitable only for small areas and short plants, insufficient power for the flowering stage of large plants.

### Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFL)

Compact fluorescent lamps with built-in ballasts and standard E27 or E40 sockets.

- **Luminous efficacy:** 50–70 lm/W
- **Wattage:** from 15 to 250 W
- **Color temperature:** typically 2700 K or 6500 K

**Pros:** easy installation (screw into a standard socket), compact size, moderate price, low heat output.

**Cons:** limited power, not suitable for large areas, gradual brightness degradation, contains mercury.

CFLs rated at 100–250 W are a good option for micro grows or as supplemental lighting.

## High-Intensity Discharge Lamps (HID)

High-Intensity Discharge (HID) lamps were the standard for indoor growing for a long time. This category includes HPS and MH lamps.

### HPS (High-Pressure Sodium)

HPS lamps are among the most widely used in growing. They emit a characteristic yellow-orange light.

- **Luminous efficacy:** 90–150 lm/W
- **Wattage:** 150, 250, 400, 600, 1000 W
- **Spectrum:** predominantly yellow-orange-red (570–620 nm), low in blue
- **Lifespan:** 12,000–24,000 hours

**Pros:** high luminous efficacy, proven effectiveness, excellent results during flowering, affordable price, wide range of wattages.

**Cons:** high heat output (requires powerful ventilation), incomplete spectrum (lacking blue), requires a ballast, high electricity consumption, fire risk if improperly installed.

The 400 W and 600 W HPS are the most popular options. The 600 W HPS is considered optimal for its power-to-efficiency ratio.

### MH (Metal Halide)

MH lamps emit white light with a high proportion of blue spectrum.

- **Luminous efficacy:** 70–100 lm/W
- **Wattage:** 150, 250, 400, 600, 1000 W
- **Spectrum:** broad, with a predominance of blue
- **Lifespan:** 6,000–15,000 hours

**Pros:** excellent spectrum for the vegetative stage, compact plant growth, natural color rendering.

**Cons:** high heat output, lower luminous efficacy compared to HPS, shorter lifespan, requires a ballast.

The classic setup is MH during vegetation and HPS during flowering. Some growers use electronic ballasts compatible with both lamp types.

### Ceramic Metal Halide (CMH / CDM / LEC)

An improved version of MH with a ceramic arc tube. These offer a more complete and stable spectrum.

- **Luminous efficacy:** 90–120 lm/W
- **Wattage:** typically 315 W or 630 W
- **Spectrum:** very broad, including UV

**Pros:** excellent spectrum, good efficiency, usable at all stages, includes a UV component.

**Cons:** high cost, requires a specialized ballast, heat output.

## LED Grow Lights

LEDs have become the dominant technology in indoor horticulture thanks to their high energy efficiency and customizable spectrum.

### Types of LED Grow Lights

- **Budget purple (blurple)** — a combination of red and blue diodes. The first generation of plant LEDs. Incomplete spectrum, often with exaggerated specifications from manufacturers.
- **Full spectrum white** — white diodes with added red. The most versatile and recommended option.
- **Quantum Boards (QB)** — panels with a large number of high-efficiency diodes such as Samsung LM301B/H, Osram, etc. The current quality standard.
- **LED bars** — linear fixtures that provide even coverage.

### LED Specifications

- **Luminous efficacy:** 150–230 lm/W (top models)
- **Efficiency:** up to 2.5–3.0 umol/J
- **Spectrum:** customizable, from narrow to full
- **Lifespan:** 50,000–100,000 hours
- **Heat output:** significantly less than HPS (but heat dissipation is still required)

**Pros:** highest energy efficiency, long lifespan, low heat output, customizable spectrum, compact size, dimmable.

**Cons:** high initial cost for quality models, market flooded with low-quality products with exaggerated specs, need to understand diodes and drivers.

## Induction Lamps

A rare but interesting type. Induction lamps have no electrodes, giving them a record-breaking lifespan.

- **Luminous efficacy:** 70–90 lm/W
- **Lifespan:** up to 100,000 hours
- **Spectrum:** depends on the phosphor; plant-specific versions are available

**Pros:** extremely long lifespan, stable luminous flux throughout the entire service life, even spectrum.

**Cons:** high cost, limited availability, average efficiency, bulky generator.

Induction lamps are a niche product that falls short of modern LEDs in most categories.

| Recommendation | Micro grow | Supplemental | Budget flower. | Budget veg. | Universal | Best choice |

## Recommendations for Choosing

### Limited Budget

If the budget is minimal, a **250–400 W HPS** with an electronic ballast remains a viable option. However, factor in the costs of ventilation and electricity.

### Best Value for Money

**LED Quantum Board** based on Samsung LM301B or LM301H diodes with a MeanWell driver. This is the current industry standard. It pays for itself within 1–2 cycles through electricity savings.

### Micro Grow (Small Space)

A **100–150 W CFL** or a compact LED fixture rated at 50–100 W.

### Professional Approach

**LED bars** or panels with dimming and spectrum control capabilities. A 315 W CMH is an alternative.

## Key Takeaways

- The manufacturer-stated wattage of LED fixtures often does not match actual power draw. Always verify the true wattage at the wall.
- For HID lamps, always use a quality ballast — electronic ballasts are preferable to magnetic ones.
- Do not skimp on ventilation when using HPS and MH — overheating is dangerous for both plants and fire safety.
- Cheap LED fixtures from marketplaces often have exaggerated specifications. Pay attention to the diodes used, the driver, and real-world test results.
