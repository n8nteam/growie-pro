# Metal Halide — MH

Metal Halide (MH) lamps occupy an important niche in indoor gardening. Their spectrum with a pronounced blue component makes them ideal for the vegetative growth stage. In this article, we'll examine how they work, their applications, and the modern evolution of the technology.

## How MH Lamps Work

A metal halide lamp is a type of high-intensity discharge (HID) lamp. Structurally, it's similar to an HPS lamp but has fundamental differences in the gas mixture composition of the burner.

The MH burner is made of quartz glass or ceramic and is filled with a mixture of mercury, argon, and halides of various metals — iodides of sodium, scandium, dysprosium, thallium, indium, and others. The specific combination of additives determines the spectral characteristics of each lamp.

When an arc discharge occurs, the metal halides evaporate and decompose near the center of the burner where the temperature is highest. The free metal atoms emit light at their characteristic wavelengths. Near the burner walls, where the temperature is lower, the metals recombine with halogens, forming a closed cycle — the so-called halogen cycle. This process prevents metal deposition on the burner walls and ensures parameter stability.

## Spectral Characteristics

The main advantage of MH over HPS is a more balanced spectrum with a pronounced blue component:

- Blue region (400–500 nm) — 25–35% of emission
- Green region (500–580 nm) — 30–35%
- Yellow-orange region (580–620 nm) — 15–20%
- Red region (620–700 nm) — 10–15%

This spectral distribution mimics spring-summer sunlight with a dominance of short-wavelength radiation. Plants under MH develop compact internodes, thick stems, and dense foliage — everything needed for quality vegetation.

The color temperature of most MH lamps for horticulture is 4200–6500 K, perceived by the eye as white or cool-white light. The Color Rendering Index (CRI) reaches 80–95, significantly higher than HPS (CRI around 25).

## Use During Vegetation

MH is ideal for the vegetative growth stage for several reasons:

- Blue spectrum activates cryptochromes and phototropins that regulate stem growth. Plants receive a signal of high sun position and grow compactly.
- Chlorophyll B has a peak absorption at 453 nm, which aligns well with the MH spectrum.
- Carotenoids, involved in photoprotection and energy transfer to chlorophyll, actively absorb blue light (420–480 nm).
- The morphogenetic effect of blue light reduces apical dominance, promoting branching.

The classic scheme for a grow box: MH during vegetation (18/6) and HPS during flowering (12/12). This allows you to use the optimal spectrum at each stage.

## Wattages and Specifications

| Wattage | Light Output | Color Temperature | Lifespan | Coverage |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|----------|----------|
| 150 W | 12,000 lm | 4200 K | 6,000 h | 40x40 cm |
| 250 W | 20,000 lm | 4200–5200 K | 8,000 h | 60x60 cm |
| 400 W | 36,000 lm | 4200–5200 K | 10,000 h | 80x80 cm |
| 600 W | 55,000 lm | 4200–5200 K | 10,000 h | 100x100 cm |
| 1000 W | 80,000 lm | 4200 K | 8,000 h | 120x120 cm |

Note that MH light output is noticeably lower than HPS of the same wattage. However, for plants what matters is not just lumens but Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR), and here the gap is smaller thanks to MH's better spectral match with plant needs during vegetation.

## Connecting MH Lamps

MH lamps require the same components as HPS:

- A ballast (magnetic or electronic) of the appropriate wattage
- An ignitor
- An E40 socket (for lamps 250 W and above) or E27 (for lower wattages)

Important connection details:

- Not all HPS ballasts are compatible with MH. Universal electronic ballasts usually support both lamp types, but this must be verified in the specifications.
- MH lamps are more sensitive to power quality than HPS. Voltage fluctuations can significantly shorten their lifespan.
- Burning position matters. Some MH lamps are designed only for horizontal operation, others only for vertical. Ignoring this requirement leads to uneven burner wear and reduced lifespan.
- MH re-strike time is 10–15 minutes after shutdown — the lamp must cool down before the ignitor can re-strike it.

## MH vs HPS Comparison

| Parameter | MH | HPS |
|-----------|-----|------|
| Spectrum | Broad, blue | Narrow, yellow-orange |
| Best stage | Vegetation | Flowering |
| Efficiency (lm/W) | 80–100 | 120–150 |
| CRI | 80–95 | 20–25 |
| Lifespan | 6,000–10,000 h | 12,000–24,000 h |
| Startup time | 3–5 min | 5–7 min |
| Re-strike time | 10–15 min | 3–5 min |
| Degradation | Faster | Slower |
| Position sensitivity | High | Low |
| Lamp cost | Higher | Lower |

## CMH/LEC — Technology Evolution

CMH (Ceramic Metal Halide) or LEC (Light Emitting Ceramic) is a modern evolution of metal halide technology in which the quartz burner is replaced with a ceramic one (made of polycrystalline aluminum oxide, as in HPS).

Advantages of CMH/LEC:

- Higher color temperature (3100–4200 K) with excellent CRI (90–95)
- Broad spectrum suitable for full-cycle growing
- UVB emission (280–315 nm), stimulating the production of secondary metabolites
- Efficiency up to 1.9 umol/J — higher than classic MH and comparable to HPS
- Better parameter stability and longer lifespan (15,000–20,000 h)
- Lower heat output at comparable PAR levels

Popular CMH lamps: Philips CDM-T 315W (3100K and 4200K), Sun System LEC 315W, Growers Choice 315W. The 315 W format has become the standard, providing effective coverage of 80x80 — 100x100 cm.

The CMH 315W is increasingly considered a universal lamp for the full cycle, competing with mid-range LEDs.

## Advantages of MH

- Optimal spectrum for vegetative growth
- Natural color rendering — convenient for visually assessing plant health
- Compact and sturdy plant structure under blue spectrum
- CMH/LEC — one of the best technologies for full-cycle growing
- Presence of ultraviolet in the spectrum
- Familiar and straightforward connection technology

## Disadvantages of MH

- Lower efficiency compared to HPS in terms of lumens
- Faster degradation — lamps need more frequent replacement
- Sensitivity to burning position
- Long re-strike time
- High heat output (comparable to HPS)
- Fragility — quartz burner is sensitive to vibrations
- CMH lamp cost is significantly higher than standard MH

Metal halide lamps are an excellent choice for the vegetative phase, and CMH/LEC is becoming an increasingly popular universal alternative to both HPS and budget LED solutions. With the right approach, MH ensures dense, healthy growth, forming the ideal foundation for subsequent abundant flowering.
