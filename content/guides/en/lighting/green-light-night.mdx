# Green Light at Night

When growing plants in a grow box, you regularly need to look inside during the dark period: check humidity, inspect for pests, tie branches, top off the reservoir. Turning on the main light is out of the question -- it would disrupt the photoperiod. But if you use a green flashlight, you can work in the box without consequences for the plants.

## Why Green Light Is Safe

### Photoperiodism and Phytochrome

Plants sense the length of day and night using a special pigment called phytochrome. Phytochrome exists in two forms:

- **Pr (red-absorbing phytochrome)** -- the inactive form. It absorbs red light (660 nm) and converts to the Pfr form
- **Pfr (far-red-absorbing phytochrome)** -- the active form. It absorbs far-red light (730 nm) and slowly reverts to Pr in the dark

During the day, red light converts Pr to Pfr. At night, Pfr slowly (over 2-4 hours) reverts to Pr. The Pfr/Pr ratio signals the plant about the length of the night. If the night is interrupted by red light, Pfr accumulates again and the plant "thinks" the night is short. For photoperiod-sensitive cultivars, this can prevent the transition to flowering or cause reversion (switching from flowering back to vegetative growth).

### Phytochrome Absorption Spectrum

Phytochrome is most sensitive to:

- Red light: 600-700 nm (peak at 660 nm)
- Far red: 700-750 nm (peak at 730 nm)
- Blue light: 400-500 nm (moderate sensitivity)

The green range (500-565 nm) is virtually not absorbed by phytochrome. Green photons "pass right by" the phytochrome molecule without triggering Pr-to-Pfr conversion. This is why green light does not disrupt the plant's perception of night length.

### Other Photoreceptors

In addition to phytochrome, plants have cryptochromes (blue light) and phototropins (blue/UV). Green light has only a weak effect on these receptors as well, further confirming its safety during the dark period.

## Wavelengths That Do Not Disrupt the Schedule

| Range | Wavelength | Effect on Phytochrome | Safety at Night |
|---|---|---|---|
| Violet/Blue | 400-500 nm | Moderate | Undesirable |
| Green | 500-565 nm | Minimal | Safe |
| Yellow | 565-590 nm | Weak | Conditionally safe |
| Orange | 590-625 nm | Noticeable | Undesirable |
| Red | 625-700 nm | Strong | Dangerous |
| Far red | 700-750 nm | Strong (reverse conversion) | Dangerous |

The safe range for nighttime work: 500-565 nm (green). Yellow (565-590 nm) is borderline -- at low intensity it is tolerable, but better not to risk it.

## Green Flashlights and Lamps

### Specialized Green Flashlights for Growers

Grow shops sell flashlights and headlamps with green LEDs. Advantages:

- Selected wavelength (usually 520-530 nm -- pure green)
- Sufficient brightness for working
- Convenient form factor (headlamp or handheld)

### Green LED Bulb (E27)

Green LED bulbs sold at hardware stores (for decorative lighting). They screw into a standard socket.

Important: make sure the bulb is truly green (with green LEDs), not a white bulb behind a green filter. A filter-based lamp lets through a small amount of red and blue, which is undesirable.

### Green Filter on a Flashlight

A green film or filter applied over a regular flashlight. A budget option, but less reliable: the film transmits some red and IR radiation, especially if the flashlight is powerful.

### Green Headlamp

Headlamps with a green LED are the optimal choice. Your hands are free, and the light points wherever you look. Many hunting and fishing models have a green mode (used for observing wildlife without startling it -- the same logic applies to plants).

## How to Choose Green Light

### Wavelength

Ideal: 520-540 nm (pure green). Acceptable: 500-560 nm. Avoid "yellow-green" (560-580 nm) -- this is closer to the yellow range and may have a weak effect on phytochrome.

### Power

For working in the box, 1-3W of green light is sufficient. More powerful sources (5W+) with prolonged use can trigger an unwanted response (see the "Limitations" section).

### Quality Check

If you doubt the spectral purity of a green lamp, check it using a CD: shine the light onto the reflective surface of a disc at an angle -- you will see a spectral breakdown. If you see a red component alongside the green, the lamp is not suitable.

## When You Need to Work in the Box at Night

Typical situations:

- **Pest inspection** -- some pests (spider mites, thrips) are more active at night and easier to spot
- **Tying and training** -- branches tied during the day settle by night, and you may need to adjust
- **Topping off the reservoir** -- if it runs low by nighttime
- **Measuring environmental parameters** -- humidity and temperature during the dark period differ from daytime values
- **Checking for light leaks** -- at night, it is easy to spot cracks where outside light enters the box (important for photoperiod-sensitive cultivars)
- **Emergencies** -- flooding, ventilation failure, etc.

## Limitations

### Intensity Matters

Green light is safe at low intensity. At very high intensity (tens of watts), even green light can have a weak photomorphogenetic effect. The reasons:

- Phytochrome has a small but nonzero absorption in the green range
- At high power, even a small absorption percentage creates a significant signal
- Cryptochromes also partially respond to high-intensity green light

Rule of thumb: use the minimum brightness you need. A 1-3W flashlight is enough for any task in the box. Do not leave a 20W green bulb on all night.

### Duration of Exposure

Short-term use (5-30 minutes) is safe. Extended (several hours) continuous exposure to green light can have a cumulative effect, although research shows that even one hour of exposure to 530 nm green light at normal flashlight power does not disrupt the photoperiod.

### Do Not Confuse Green with Everything Else

Keep in mind:

- A phone with a green screen is not a substitute for a green flashlight (the screen emits white light; green only dominates)
- A green lamp on the same timer as the main light will not help -- the timer will turn it on along with everything else
- Equipment indicator LEDs (red LEDs on fans, power supplies) can disrupt the schedule if positioned close to plants. Cover them with opaque tape

## Practical Tips

- Keep a green flashlight near the box -- so you do not have to search for it in the dark
- When entering the box, wait 10-15 seconds -- your eyes will adapt to the green light, and you will see better
- Direct the light at a specific area rather than scattering it across the entire box
- After finishing, make sure the flashlight is off and the box is completely dark
- Do not work in the box at night too often -- every intervention during the dark period, even with green light, creates a minimal disturbance

A green flashlight is a small but important tool in a grower's kit. It costs little but lets you maintain the box at any time of day without risking a disruption to the light schedule.
