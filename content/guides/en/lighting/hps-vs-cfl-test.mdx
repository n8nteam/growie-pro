# HPS vs CFL: A Comparative Test

The endless debate over which is better — HPS or CFL — can only be settled with a practical test. This article describes a typical comparative experiment under controlled conditions, clearly demonstrating the difference between the two lighting types at every stage of the plant life cycle.

## Test Description

### Experimental Conditions

For a fair comparison, all conditions must be equalized as much as possible, except for the lighting type:

- Two identical 60x60x160 cm grow tents
- Identical substrate (soil with perlite, 70/30)
- Identical nutrients and watering schedule
- Identical ventilation (100 mm inline fan + carbon filter)
- Same plant variety (autoflowering hybrid to reduce genetic variability)
- Seeds from the same pack, germinated simultaneously
- Same light schedule: 20/4 throughout the cycle (autoflower)

### Lighting

Box A — HPS:

- 250 W HPS lamp (Philips SON-T)
- Electronic ballast
- Wing reflector

Box B — CFL:

- 4 CFL lamps at 55 W each, E27 (2 pcs 6500K + 2 pcs 2700K) during vegetation
- Switched to 3 pcs 2700K + 1 pc 6500K for flowering
- Total power: 220 W

Wattage was chosen to be close for a fair comparison: 250 W vs 220 W. Electricity costs would be virtually identical.

## Parameters Measured

The following parameters were recorded throughout the test:

- Air temperature at canopy level and pot level
- PPFD (Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density) at canopy level
- Plant height
- Stem diameter
- Number of internodes
- Leaf surface area (visual estimate)
- Flowering onset timing
- Final dry yield weight
- Overall quality (density, aroma — subjective assessment)

## Light Measurements

PPFD was measured at the working distance appropriate for each lighting type:

### HPS 250 W (30 cm from lamp)

| Point | PPFD (umol/m2/s) |
|-------|------------------|
| Center | 620 |
| 15 cm from center | 480 |
| 30 cm from center (edge) | 280 |
| Average across 60x60 area | 420 |

### CFL 4x55 W (10 cm from lamps)

| Point | PPFD (umol/m2/s) |
|-------|------------------|
| Under lamp 1 | 310 |
| Under lamp 2 | 305 |
| Between lamps | 260 |
| Edge of area | 150 |
| Average across 60x60 area | 245 |

Difference in average PPFD: HPS delivers 1.7 times more photosynthetically active radiation per unit area. The HPS advantage is even greater at the center (2x) and somewhat less toward the edges.

## Stage-by-Stage Results

### Stage 1: Sprouts (Days 1–7)

In the first week after germination, the difference is minimal. Seedlings under both sources looked identical: sturdy with open cotyledons.

Slight CFL advantage: thanks to close placement (5 cm from tops) and a predominantly blue spectrum (6500K), seedlings didn't stretch at all. Under HPS at 35–40 cm, seedlings showed slight stretching (1–1.5 cm of hypocotyl).

Temperature: HPS box — 27°C at pot level, CFL box — 24°C. Both within normal range.

### Stage 2: Vegetation (Days 8–28)

This is where the divergence begins:

HPS Box:

- Height by day 28: 22 cm
- Stem diameter: 8 mm
- Internodes: slightly elongated (2–3 cm) due to blue light deficiency
- Large, sprawling leaves
- Overall appearance: healthy but somewhat stretched plant

CFL Box:

- Height by day 28: 15 cm
- Stem diameter: 7 mm
- Internodes: short (1–1.5 cm) thanks to blue spectrum
- Slightly smaller leaves but more densely arranged
- Overall appearance: compact, bushy habit

During vegetation, CFL shows an advantage in compactness, which is critically important for small spaces. HPS produces faster linear growth, but that's not always desirable.

### Stage 3: Early Flowering (Days 28–42)

The autoflowers began showing pistils at approximately the same time — around day 26–28. Lighting type did not affect flowering initiation timing (in autoflowers, this is genetically determined, not photoperiod-dependent).

During this period, the CFL box had its lamps swapped: from 2x6500K + 2x2700K to 1x6500K + 3x2700K to increase the red component.

HPS Box: the plant actively stretched 8–10 cm over two weeks (the stretch). Flower clusters began forming, gaining volume quickly.

CFL Box: stretch was less pronounced — 5–7 cm. Flowers formed but more slowly and smaller.

### Stage 4: Active Flowering (Days 42–63)

This stage shows the greatest difference:

HPS Box:

- Dense flower clusters, increasing daily
- Abundant resin production
- Strong aroma by day 50
- Plant consuming lots of water and nutrients — a sign of active metabolism
- Temperature 28–30°C at the tops (lamp kept at 40 cm)

CFL Box:

- Less dense, somewhat loose flower clusters
- Moderate resin production
- Aroma appears later — around day 55
- Lower water and nutrient consumption
- Temperature 25–26°C — comfortable zone

### Stage 5: Ripening and Harvest (Days 63–75)

HPS Box: the plant was ready for harvest by day 70. Dense, heavy flower clusters abundantly covered in trichomes. Leaves yellowed evenly (the final flush went smoothly).

CFL Box: ripening arrived by day 73–75 (3–5 days later). Medium-density flower clusters, trichomes less abundant but present. Overall appearance — a neat, compact plant.

## Yield Weight

Weighing results after drying and curing (14 days drying, 14 days curing):

| Parameter | HPS Box 250 W | CFL Box 220 W |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Dry weight of main cola | 18.2 g | 8.5 g |
| Dry weight of side colas | 14.3 g | 9.1 g |
| Total dry weight | 32.5 g | 17.6 g |
| Weight per watt consumed | 0.13 g/W | 0.08 g/W |
| Weight per square meter | 90 g/m2 | 49 g/m2 |

HPS produced nearly double the yield at comparable power consumption. And not just quantitatively — density and resin production were also higher.

## Yield Quality

Subjective rating on a 5-point scale:

| Criterion | HPS | CFL |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| Flower density | 4.5 | 3.0 |
| Aroma | 4.5 | 3.5 |
| Resin production (visual) | 4.5 | 3.0 |
| Overall impression | 4.5 | 3.2 |

Interestingly, the CFL harvest's aroma, while less intense, was quite pleasant. The quality isn't poor — there's simply less of it.

## Economic Analysis

| Expense Category | HPS | CFL |
|------------------|-----|-----|
| Fixture cost | $55 (lamp + ballast + reflector) | $25 (4 lamps + sockets) |
| Electricity per cycle (75 days, 20/4) | 250 W x 20 h x 75 days = 375 kWh | 220 W x 20 h x 75 days = 330 kWh |
| Electricity cost ($0.12/kWh) | $45 | $40 |
| Ventilation (additional for HPS) | 150 W x 20 h x 75 days = 225 kWh = $27 | Minimal: ~$5 |
| Total expenses | $127 | $70 |
| Yield | 32.5 g | 17.6 g |
| Cost per gram | $3.91/g | $3.98/g |

Surprisingly, the cost per gram is comparable. HPS spends more on electricity and equipment but compensates with yield volume. CFL saves on equipment and electricity but produces less.

## Conclusions

Based on the comparative test results, several conclusions can be drawn:

- HPS wins decisively on yield volume and quality at comparable wattage. If the goal is maximum results from a 60x60 cm area, choose a 250 W HPS.

- CFL is better during the vegetative stage: compact plants with short internodes are a credit to the blue spectrum. An ideal starting phase.

- The difference emerges during flowering. It's at the flower formation stage that light intensity becomes critically important, and this is where HPS reveals its potential.

- Production costs are comparable, but scalability differs. HPS uses floor space more efficiently.

- CFL is justified for small spaces (40x40 cm and under), where HPS creates excessive heat, and for cases where stealth and simplicity matter more than yield volume.

- A hybrid approach: vegetation under CFL 6500K, then moving to HPS for flowering — an excellent compromise for those who have both lamp types.

This test confirms a long-known truth: in plant cultivation, light equals yield. More photons hitting the leaves means more sugars, more biomass, more end product. HPS delivers more photons per watt than CFL, and this directly translates into results.
