# Nutrient Toxicity and Overfeeding

![Nutrient burn](/images/guides/nutrient-burn.jpg)

Overfeeding (nutrient burn) is one of the main beginner mistakes. "More nutrients = bigger yield" — not true! Excess nutrients are more dangerous than deficiency. Let's cover all types of toxicity and treatment methods.

## General Signs of Overfeeding (Nutrient Burn)

### Symptoms

**Early:**
- **Dark green leaves** (excess nitrogen = lots of chlorophyll)
- **"Claws"** — leaf tips curling down (clawing)
- Shiny, glossy leaves

**Progressing:**
- **"Burnt" tips and edges** — brown, dry, crispy
- Burns start at tips, spread along edges
- Leaves curl, deform

**Critical:**
- Leaves completely brown, dying
- Growth stopped
- **Nutrient lockout** — plant can't absorb anything (even with correct pH)
- Plant may die

### Where symptoms appear

**Different from deficiencies:**
- **Nutrient burn** affects **ALL leaves** (bottom, middle, top)
- **Deficiencies** — specific levels (bottom or top)

**Sequence:**
1. First leaf tips (new and middle leaves)
2. Then edges
3. Then entire leaf

## Causes of Overfeeding

### 1. Nutrient concentration too high

**Problem:**
"I'll give double dose for faster growth!"

**Why wrong:**
Plant absorbs what it needs. Excess accumulates in tissues → toxicity.

**Solution:**
✅ Follow manufacturer's instructions
✅ Start with 1/4-1/2 dose for seedlings/autos
✅ Gradually increase to full dose

### 2. High EC (Electrical Conductivity)

**What it is:**
EC measures dissolved salts (nutrients) in water.

**EC Norms:**

| Stage | EC (mS/cm) |
|-------|------------|
| Seedling | 0.4-0.8 |
| Early Veg | 0.8-1.2 |
| Late Veg | 1.2-1.6 |
| Early Flower | 1.4-1.8 |
| Late Flower | 1.6-2.0 |

**Critical:** EC >2.2 = guaranteed overfeeding!

**Solution:**
✅ Buy EC meter ($15-30)
✅ Check EC of solution before each watering
✅ Check EC of runoff (water draining from pot)

### 3. Salt buildup in medium

**Problem:**
You water with nutrients constantly → salts accumulate in soil → EC rises → toxicity.

**How to identify:**
- EC of runoff >2.0
- White crust on soil surface (salts)
- Pot edges covered with white/yellow crust

**Solution:**
✅ Flush medium (see below)
✅ Alternate watering: nutrients → plain water → nutrients

### 4. Wrong pH

**Problem:**
pH too low (<5.5) or high (>7.0) → some elements absorbed excessively, others blocked.

**Solution:**
✅ Check pH every watering
✅ Soil: 6.0-6.5
✅ Hydro/coco: 5.8-6.2

## Individual Element Toxicity

### Nitrogen (N) — Most Common Toxicity

#### Nitrogen Excess Symptoms

**Early:**
- **Very dark green leaves** (almost black-green)
- **"Claws"** — leaves curling down (especially at tips)
- Shiny, glossy leaves

**Progressing:**
- Leaves brittle, fragile
- Slow growth (excess N blocks flowering)
- **Flowering start delayed** (plant doesn't switch to 12/12)
- Stretching (long internodes)

**Critical:**
- Buds small, airy (energy went to leaves)
- Low yield
- Increased susceptibility to mold (excess nitrogen = juicy tissues)

**Important:** Nitrogen excess during flowering is critical! Reduces yield by 20-40%.

#### Treatment

1. **Stop nitrogen feeding:**
   - Switch to Bloom nutrients (low N)
   - Or skip 2-3 waterings without nutrients

2. **Flush medium** (if critical):
   - Clean water pH 6.0
   - Volume: 3x pot size (10L pot = 30L water / 2.5 gal = 7.5 gal)

3. **Wait 7-14 days:**
   - New leaves will grow healthy
   - Old "claws" won't fix (but won't drop)

**Prevention:**
✅ Switch to Bloom nutrients from first day of flowering
✅ Don't use Grow during flowering!

### Phosphorus (P)

#### Excess Symptoms

- Blocks **zinc, iron, calcium** absorption
- Symptoms of these deficiencies (yellow leaves, interveinal chlorosis)
- Brown spots on leaves

#### Treatment

- Stop PK boosters
- Flush medium
- Add CalMag (compensates blocked calcium)

---

### Potassium (K)

#### Excess Symptoms

- Blocks **calcium and magnesium**
- Symptoms: interveinal chlorosis, brown spots (like Ca/Mg deficiency)

#### Treatment

- Stop PK boosters
- Add CalMag

---

### Calcium (Ca)

#### Excess Symptoms

- Very rare!
- Blocks **magnesium and potassium**
- Interveinal chlorosis on lower leaves

#### Treatment

- Stop CalMag
- Add Epsom Salt (magnesium)

---

### Magnesium (Mg)

#### Excess Symptoms

- Rare!
- Blocks **calcium**
- Calcium deficiency symptoms (brown spots on new leaves)

## How to Flush Medium (Flushing)

### When to flush?

**Indications:**
- EC of runoff >2.2
- Critical nutrient burn (leaves brown)
- White crust on soil
- Pre-harvest preparation (7-14 days before)

### Flushing Process

#### Step 1: Prepare water

- **Amount:** 3x pot volume
  - 2 gal pot = 6 gal water (7L pot = 21L water)
  - 3 gal pot = 9 gal water (11L pot = 33L water)
- **pH:** 6.0 (soil/coco) or 5.8 (hydro)
- **Temperature:** room temp (68-75°F / 20-24°C)

#### Step 2: Flush

1. **Pour slowly:**
   - Pour water evenly across entire surface
   - Wait for drainage
   - Repeat until all water used

2. **Let drain:**
   - Wait 15-30 minutes
   - All excess water should drain

#### Step 3: Check runoff EC

- Collect drained water
- Measure EC
- **Goal:** EC <1.0 (almost clean water)
- If EC >1.5 → flush again

#### Step 4: Wait to dry

- Don't water 3-7 days (until soil dries)
- Pot should be light (check weight)

#### Step 5: Resume feeding

- **First watering:** 1/4 dose nutrients
- **Second watering:** 1/2 dose
- **Third watering:** full dose

### Flushing Mistakes

❌ **Flushed with cold water** → root shock
❌ **Didn't check pH** → nutrient lockout
❌ **Didn't let dry** → overwatering, root rot
❌ **Immediately gave full dose** → new burn

## Nutrient Lockout (Nutrient Block)

### What it is

**Nutrient lockout** — plant can't absorb nutrients, even if they're in the medium.

**Causes:**
1. **Wrong pH** (main cause!)
2. **Excess of some elements blocks others**
   - Excess N → blocks Ca, Mg
   - Excess P → blocks Zn, Fe
   - Excess K → blocks Ca, Mg
   - Excess Ca → blocks Mg, K
3. **Very high EC** (>2.5)

### Symptoms

- **Simultaneously** signs of **multiple deficiencies**
- Yellow leaves + brown spots + edge necrosis
- Doesn't respond to feeding
- Rapid deterioration

### Treatment

1. **Flush medium** (mandatory!)
2. **Check and correct pH:**
   - Soil: 6.0-6.5
   - Hydro/coco: 5.8-6.2
3. **Resume feeding at 1/4 dose**
4. **Wait 10-14 days** (recovery is slow)

## How to Prevent Overfeeding

### Prevention Checklist

✅ **Start small:**
- Seedlings: 1/4 dose
- Autos: 1/2 dose
- Photos: 3/4-full dose

✅ **Control EC:**
- Buy EC meter
- Check solution and runoff
- Runoff EC shouldn't be >0.3 higher than solution EC

✅ **Alternate waterings:**
- Nutrients → plain water → nutrients

✅ **Control pH:**
- Every watering!
- Soil: 6.0-6.5
- Hydro/coco: 5.8-6.2

✅ **Keep diary:**
- Log nutrient doses
- Log EC and pH
- Log plant reactions

✅ **Better underfeed:**
- Deficiency easy to fix (5-7 days)
- Overfeeding can kill (14-30 days recovery)

## Table: Deficiency vs Toxicity

| Sign | Deficiency | Toxicity |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Where symptoms** | Specific level (bottom or top) | All leaves |
| **Speed** | Slow (weeks) | Fast (days) |
| **Leaf color** | Pale, light | Dark green (N excess) |
| **Tips** | Yellow/brown on specific leaves | Burnt on all leaves |
| **Response to feeding** | Improvement in 5-7 days | Worsening |
| **EC** | Low (<1.0) | High (>2.0) |

## Recovery After Overfeeding

### How long?

| Burn Level | Recovery Time |
|------------|---------------|
| Light (tips brown) | 7-10 days |
| Medium (edges brown) | 14-21 days |
| Heavy (leaves dying) | 21-30 days |
| Critical (nutrient lockout) | 30-45 days or won't recover |

### What to do during recovery

✅ **Don't panic**
- Damaged leaves won't recover (normal)
- Wait for new healthy leaves

✅ **Don't "treat" with feeding**
- Don't add nutrients first 7-10 days
- Only plain water pH 6.0

✅ **Create optimal conditions:**
- Temperature: 72-79°F (22-26°C)
- Humidity: 50-60%
- Light: full power (photosynthesis = recovery)

✅ **Remove dead leaves:**
- If leaf completely brown → remove
- If partially brown → leave (still photosynthesizing)

## Growie's Advice

Remember the rule: **better underfeed than overfeed!** Deficiency fixes in a week, overfeeding can kill the plant or reduce yield by 30-50%. Always start with small doses (1/4-1/2 of instructions), gradually increase until plants say "stop" (slight leaf darkening = optimal). Buy an EC meter for $20 — best investment to protect from overfeeding! In Growie, log nutrient doses and EC of every watering — after 2-3 cycles you'll find the perfect dose for your conditions. And remember: dark green leaves + "claws" = immediately stop nitrogen feeding!
