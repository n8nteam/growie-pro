# Plant Problem Diagnosis: General Approach

![Diagnosis](/images/guides/plant-diagnosis.jpg)

See a problem on leaves, but don't know what it is? Systematic approach helps diagnose in 5 minutes. Use this checklist every time.

## 5-Step Diagnosis System

### Step 1: Where are symptoms?

**Question:** Which leaves show the problem?

**Lower old leaves:**
→ Mobile elements (N, P, K, Mg, Zn)
→ Plant "pulls" element from old leaves

**Upper new leaves:**
→ Immobile elements (Ca, Fe, S, B, Mn)
→ Or environmental stress (light, temperature)

**All leaves:**
→ Overfeeding (nutrient burn)
→ pH problems (nutrient lockout)
→ Pests
→ Environmental stress

**Quick Diagnosis Table:**

| Where | What | Likely Problem |
|-------|------|----------------|
| Bottom | Yellowing | Nitrogen (N) or underwatering |
| Bottom | Brown edges | Potassium (K) |
| Bottom | Interveinal chlorosis | Magnesium (Mg) |
| Top | Yellow with green veins | Iron (Fe) |
| Top | Brown spots | Calcium (Ca) |
| All | Burnt tips | Overfeeding / pH |
| All | Dots, webbing | Pests |

### Step 2: What color/shape?

**Yellow leaves:**
- Bottom → Nitrogen, underwatering
- Top → Iron, Sulfur
- Interveinal (bottom) → Magnesium

**Brown:**
- Edges (bottom) → Potassium
- Spots (top) → Calcium
- Tips (all) → Overfeeding

**Curled:**
- Down ("claws") → Nitrogen excess, wind stress
- Up ("canoe") → Heat stress
- Inward → Underwatering, low humidity

**Wilted:**
- Heavy, green → Overwatering
- Dry, crispy → Underwatering

### Step 3: Check conditions

**MUST CHECK FIRST:**

✅ **Solution pH:**
   - Soil: 6.0-6.5
   - Hydro/coco: 5.8-6.2
   - **80% of problems from pH!**

✅ **EC (if have EC meter):**
   - Seedling: 0.4-0.8
   - Veg: 0.8-1.6
   - Flowering: 1.4-2.0
   - >2.2 = overfeeding

✅ **Temperature:**
   - 68-82°F (20-28°C)
   - <64°F or >86°F = stress

✅ **Humidity:**
   - Veg: 50-70%
   - Flowering: 40-50%
   - >70% = mold risk

✅ **Watering:**
   - Soil: top layer dry?
   - Pot weight: light or heavy?

### Step 4: When did it start?

**Suddenly (1-2 days):**
- Stress (light, temperature, wind)
- Over/underwatering
- Mechanical damage

**Slowly (week+):**
- Nutrient deficiency
- pH problems
- Root bound (small pot)

**Progressing fast:**
- Pests (mites double every 3 days)
- Diseases (mold, rot)
- Critical deficiency

### Step 5: Other signs?

**Webbing, dots, moving insects:**
→ Pests

**White coating, mold:**
→ Diseases

**Rotting smell:**
→ Root rot

**Plant doesn't respond to feeding:**
→ pH problems (nutrient lockout)

## AI Diagnosis in Growie

**Growie app includes AI diagnosis:**

### How to use:

1. **Photo** problem leaf (clear photo, good lighting)
2. **AI analyzes** image in seconds
3. **Get diagnosis:**
   - What it is (deficiency, disease, pest, stress)
   - Causes
   - How to treat
4. **Log in diary:**
   - Problem recorded
   - Track treatment
   - AI considers history

### AI Accuracy:

- **Deficiencies:** 85-90% accuracy
- **Diseases:** 80-85%
- **Pests:** 75-80%
- **Stress:** 70-75%

**Important:** AI is helper, not replacement for experience. Always check pH and conditions first!

## Common Diagnosis Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Diagnosis by one symptom

**Wrong:**
"Leaves yellow = nitrogen!" → Gave nitrogen → Got worse

**Right:**
Checked pH → was 7.5 → Nitrogen not absorbing due to pH → Corrected pH → Problem solved

### Mistake 2: Didn't check conditions

**Wrong:**
Immediately look for deficiency → Buy nutrients

**Right:**
Checked pH, EC, temperature → Found cause → Fixed conditions

### Mistake 3: "Treating" with feeding

**Wrong:**
Plant bad → Give more nutrients → Got worse (overfeeding)

**Right:**
Plant bad → Checked pH/EC → Flushed medium → Started with small doses

### Mistake 4: Panic and radical actions

**Wrong:**
Saw problem → Transplanted, flushed, changed nutrients in one day → Plant in shock

**Right:**
Saw problem → Diagnosed → Fixed ONE thing → Wait 3-5 days → Evaluate

## Action Priority Table

| Problem | Urgency | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Pests (mites, thrips) | Critical! | Immediately isolate + treatment |
| Mold (bud rot) | Critical! | Cut affected + lower RH |
| Overwatering + root rot | Very urgent | Stop watering + H₂O₂ |
| Heat stress (>90°F / 32°C) | Urgent | Lower temperature now |
| Light burn | Urgent | Raise light |
| Nitrogen deficiency | Medium | Feed (5-7 days recovery) |
| Other deficiencies | Medium | Check pH → feed |
| Light overfeeding | Low | Skip watering with nutrients |

## Golden Diagnosis Rule

**Check simple first:**
1. pH — 80% of problems!
2. Watering — over/underwatering
3. Temperature and humidity
4. Only then nutrients

**Occam's Razor:**
"Simplest explanation usually correct"
- Leaves wilted? → Watering, not magnesium deficiency!
- Tips brown? → pH or EC, not potassium!

## Growie's Advice

Buy pH meter ($15), thermometer/hygrometer ($10), and 60x magnifier ($5) — these $30 solve 90% of problems! Every morning: 2-minute inspection + 1-minute conditions check = early detection. In Growie, keep diary of EVERY problem: what, when, how treated, recovery time — after 2-3 cycles you'll be diagnosis expert!
