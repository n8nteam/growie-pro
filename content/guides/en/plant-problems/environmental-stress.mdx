# Environmental Stress

![Environmental stress](/images/guides/environmental-stress.jpg)

Wrong conditions (light, temperature, humidity, wind) cause stress. Plant slows growth, yields less, can die. Let's cover all types of stress and how to avoid them.

## Light Burn

### Symptoms
- **Bleached, white tops** (albino)
- Top leaves yellow, crispy
- Only where closest to light
- Leaves curling upward

### Causes
- Light too close to plants
- Light too powerful for stage (seedling under 600W HPS)

### Distance from Lights

| Light Type | Wattage | Distance |
|------------|---------|----------|
| LED (full spectrum) | 100-200W | 12-18 inches (30-45 cm) |
| LED | 300-400W | 16-24 inches (40-60 cm) |
| LED | 600W+ | 24-30 inches (60-75 cm) |
| HPS/MH | 250W | 12-18 inches (30-45 cm) |
| HPS/MH | 400W | 18-24 inches (45-60 cm) |
| HPS/MH | 600W | 24-30 inches (60-75 cm) |
| HPS/MH | 1000W | 30-36 inches (75-90 cm) |

### Treatment
✅ Raise light 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) higher
✅ Or lower power (if dimmable)
✅ Damaged leaves won't recover (but don't remove — still photosynthesize)
✅ New leaves will grow healthy

---

## Heat Stress

### Symptoms
- **"Canoe" leaves** — curling up at edges (taco leaves)
- Leaf tips curling up
- Leaf edges brown, dry
- Growth slowing
- Buds airy, fluffy (during flowering)

### Causes
- Temperature &gt;86°F (30°C)
- Poor ventilation
- Lights too powerful/close (heat from lights)

### Optimal Temperatures

| Stage | Day | Night |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Seedling | 72-77°F (22-25°C) | 64-72°F (18-22°C) |
| Vegetation | 72-82°F (22-28°C) | 64-75°F (18-24°C) |
| Flowering | 68-79°F (20-26°C) | 64-72°F (18-22°C) |

**Critical:** &gt;90°F (32°C) = serious stress!

### Treatment
✅ Lower temperature:
   - Increase exhaust (stronger fan)
   - Turn on AC
   - Raise light
   - Add circulation fans
✅ Water more often (but don't overwater!)
✅ Raise humidity to 50-60% (helps plant cool)

---

## Cold Stress

### Symptoms
- **Purple/red leaves and stems** (but can be genetics!)
- Leaves dark green
- Growth slowing (metabolism slows)
- Leaves droopy, wilting

### Causes
- Temperature &lt;64°F (18°C)
- Especially at night
- Cold water for watering

### Treatment
✅ Heating:
   - Heater in room/tent
   - Heat mat under pots (for roots)
✅ Use warm water (68-75°F / 20-24°C)
✅ Close exhaust at night (partially, to keep heat)

**Important:** Purple colors from cold ≠ bad (but growth slows). Some intentionally cool for color.

## Light Deficiency

### Symptoms
- **Stretching** — long internodes, thin stem
- Pale green leaves
- Lower leaves yellow, die (don't get light)
- Small buds, airy
- Plant leans toward light

### Causes
- Weak light (insufficient power)
- Light too far
- Wrong spectrum (missing red/blue)

### Minimum Light Requirements

| Area | LED | HPS |
|------|-----|-----|
| 2×2 ft (60×60 cm) | 150-200W | 250W |
| 2.5×2.5 ft (80×80 cm) | 250-320W | 400W |
| 3×3 ft (100×100 cm) | 400-480W | 600W |
| 4×4 ft (120×120 cm) | 600-720W | 1000W |

### Treatment
✅ Increase light power
✅ Lower light closer (but don't overheat!)
✅ Add side lighting (for lower branches)

---

## Wind Burn

### Symptoms
- **"Claws"** — leaves curling down
- Leaves on fan side twisted, deformed
- Leaf tips brown, dry
- Looks like nitrogen excess (but only where wind blows!)

### Causes
- Fan blowing **directly** on plants (too strong flow)
- Fan too close

### Treatment
✅ Redirect fan:
   - Blow on wall/ceiling (not on plants!)
   - Create general circulation
✅ Lower fan speed
✅ Move fan farther

**Important:** Circulation needed! But not direct strong flow.

---

## Low Humidity

### Symptoms
- Leaf edges dry, brown
- Leaves curl inward (protection from evaporation)
- Slow growth
- VPD too high (plant can't transpire)

### Causes
- Humidity &lt;30% RH
- Especially critical for seedlings

### Optimal Humidity

| Stage | RH |
|-------|----|
| Seedling | 65-75% |
| Vegetation | 50-70% |
| Early Flowering | 50-60% |
| Late Flowering | 40-50% |
| Last 2 weeks | 35-45% |

### Treatment
✅ Humidifier ($30-60)
✅ Wet towels in tent (temporary)
✅ Open water containers
✅ Misting (veg stage only!)

---

## High Humidity

### Symptoms
- **Mold** (powdery mildew, bud rot) — main danger!
- Leaf edema (bumps on leaves)
- Transpiration slowing

### Causes
- Humidity &gt;70% RH during flowering
- Poor air circulation

### Treatment
✅ Dehumidifier ($150-300)
✅ Increase exhaust (remove humid air)
✅ More circulation fans
✅ Lower temperature (cold air holds less moisture)
✅ Defoliation (remove leaves — less transpiration)

**Critical:** &gt;60% RH during late veg/flowering = high mold risk!

---

## Optimal Conditions Checklist

### Vegetation
- Temperature: 72-82°F (22-28°C)
- Humidity: 50-70% RH
- Light: 18/6 or 24/0
- Circulation: constant, not directly on plants

### Flowering
- Temperature: 68-79°F (20-26°C)
- Humidity: 40-50% RH (last 2 weeks: 35-45%)
- Light: 12/12 (photos) or 18/6 (autos)
- Circulation: enhanced (mold prevention)

### Control Tools
✅ Thermometer/hygrometer ($5-15) — mandatory!
✅ Exhaust fan with control
✅ Circulation fans (2-3 units)
✅ Humidifier / Dehumidifier (as needed)
✅ Heater / AC (by climate)

## Growie's Advice

Buy a thermometer/hygrometer for $10 and control conditions daily — 50% of problems will solve themselves! Plants can survive brief stress (1-2 days heat), but constant stress (week at 90°F / 32°C) kills yield. In Growie, log temperature and humidity twice daily (morning and evening) — you'll see patterns and can correct before problems. And remember: during flowering humidity &gt;60% = mold guaranteed, keep 40-50% RH last 6 weeks!
