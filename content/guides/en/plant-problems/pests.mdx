# Cannabis Pests: Diagnosis and Control

![Pests](/images/guides/pests.jpg)

Pests can destroy your crop in weeks. Early detection is key to successful control. Let's cover all major enemies and how to eliminate them.

## Spider Mites — Enemy #1

### Description

**Size:** 0.5 mm (almost invisible to naked eye)
**Color:** Red-brown dots
**Location:** Underside of leaves

### Infestation Signs

**Early:**
- Small **yellow/white dots** on leaves (bite marks)
- Dots first on lower leaves

**Progressing:**
- **Webbing** on leaves and between branches
- Leaves yellowing, drying
- Small moving dots (mites)

**Critical:**
- Entire plant in webbing
- Leaves dying
- Growth stopped

### Life Cycle

- Egg → larva → nymph → adult = **7-10 days**
- One female lays 100-200 eggs
- At 77°F (25°C) reproduction **explosive** (doubles population every 3 days)

**Important:** Cold (<6lt;64°F / 18°C) slows reproduction!

### Control Methods

#### 1. Mechanical Removal (early stage)

- Wash leaves with water (strong spray)
- Especially underside
- Repeat every 2 days (3-5 times)

#### 2. Insecticidal Soap

**What:** Special soap that kills mites

**How:**
- Spray all leaves (top and bottom)
- Repeat every 3 days (4-5 times)
- Do in evening (not in light!)

#### 3. Neem Oil

**Pros:** Organic, safe
**Cons:** Unpleasant smell

**How:**
- 2-3 ml per 1 L water
- Spray completely
- Every 5-7 days

**Important:** DON'T use during flowering (ruins taste)!

#### 4. Predatory Mites (biocontrol)

**What:** Phytoseiulus persimilis — predator that eats spider mites

**Pros:**
- Organic solution
- Effective

**Cons:**
- Expensive ($30-50)
- Needs temperature &gt;68°F (20°C)

#### 5. Chemical Insecticides (last resort)

**Examples:** Avid, Floramite

**Important:**
❌ DON'T use during flowering!
❌ Toxic
❌ Veg stage only

### Prevention

✅ Humidity &gt;50% (mites love dryness)
✅ Temperature &lt;77°F (25°C)
✅ Inspect plants daily (magnifier!)
✅ Quarantine new plants (2 weeks separate)
✅ Sticky traps (yellow) — early detection

## Fungus Gnats

### Signs

- Small **black flies** flying around plants
- **Larvae** (white worms) in top soil layer
- Growth slowing (larvae eat roots)

### Life Cycle

- Egg → larva → pupa → adult = 3-4 weeks
- Lay eggs in **wet soil**

### Control Methods

#### 1. Soil Drying (main!)

- Let top soil layer (2 inches / 5 cm) **completely dry**
- Larvae die without moisture
- Water less frequently, smaller volumes

#### 2. Sticky Traps (yellow)

- Catch adult flies
- $5-10 per pack

#### 3. Bacillus thuringiensis (BTI)

**What:** Bacteria that kills larvae

**How:**
- Mosquito Bits or Gnatrol
- Mix in water per instructions
- Water soil
- Repeat weekly (3-4 times)

#### 4. Hydrogen Peroxide

- 3% H₂O₂: 1 part to 4 parts water
- Water soil (kills larvae)
- Repeat weekly

### Prevention

✅ Don't overwater
✅ Good drainage (perlite in soil)
✅ Cover top soil with sand (1 inch / 2-3 cm) — flies can't lay eggs

## Thrips

### Signs

- **Silver streaks/trails** on leaves
- Small black dots (feces)
- Leaves deform, curl
- Insects 1-2 mm, elongated

### Control Methods

- Sticky traps (blue for thrips)
- Spinosad (organic insecticide)
- Neem Oil
- Remove affected leaves

---

## Aphids

### Signs

- Green/black small insects (2-3 mm)
- Colonies on stems and leaf undersides
- Sticky substance (honeydew)
- Leaves curl, yellow

### Control Methods

- Wash with water (strong spray)
- Insecticidal soap
- Neem Oil
- Ladybugs (biocontrol)

---

## Whiteflies

### Signs

- Small **white flies** (2-3 mm) fly up when you touch plant
- Leaves yellow, sticky
- Larvae on leaf underside (white scales)

### Control Methods

- Sticky traps (yellow)
- Insecticidal soap
- Neem Oil
- Vacuum (suck up adult flies)

## General Pest Control Rules

### Checklist

✅ **Early detection:**
- Inspect plants daily
- Use 60x magnifier
- Sticky traps as indicator

✅ **Quarantine:**
- Isolate infected plant
- Treat ALL plants (pests spread!)

✅ **Repeated treatments:**
- Once won't help!
- Minimum 3-4 treatments with intervals

✅ **Don't use during flowering:**
- Neem Oil, insecticides ruin taste
- Only mechanical methods or predators

✅ **Cleanliness:**
- Wash hands before work
- Sterilize tools
- Don't bring plants/flowers from outside

## Growie's Advice

Inspect plants EVERY day with magnifier — early detection saves the crop! One spider mite turns into thousands in 2 weeks. Put yellow sticky traps as soon as you start growing — they'll show pests before you see symptoms. In Growie, log every inspection: saw pests, which ones, what you did — helps track treatment effectiveness. And remember: prevention (humidity, cleanliness, quarantine) is 10x easier than treating infestation!
