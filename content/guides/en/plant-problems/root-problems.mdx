# Root System Problems

![Root problems](/images/guides/root-problems.jpg)

Healthy roots = healthy plant. 90% of problems start with roots. Learn to recognize root zone issues — you'll save the plant before symptoms appear on leaves.

## Overwatering — Beginner Mistake #1

### Symptoms
- **Droopy, wilted leaves** (hanging down, look "heavy")
- Leaves dark green, swollen
- Soil constantly wet
- Growth slowing
- Lower leaves yellow, drop
- Stem at base soft

**Important:** Different from underwatering — overwatering leaves wilted BUT green, underwatering — dry and curling.

### Causes
- **Too frequent watering** (watering daily)
- Soil doesn't dry
- Poor drainage (no holes in pot)
- Pot too large for small plant

### Consequences
- Roots "suffocate" (no oxygen)
- Root rot (anaerobic bacteria multiply)
- Nutrient deficiencies (roots don't absorb)
- Plant can die

### Treatment
✅ **Stop watering!**
   - Wait 3-7 days until soil dries
   - Pot should become light

✅ **Improve drainage:**
   - Add holes to pot (if none)
   - Lift pot (so water drains)

✅ **Check roots** (if critical):
   - Remove plant from pot
   - Inspect roots:
     - White/light = healthy ✅
     - Brown/black = rot ❌
   - If rot — see "Root Rot"

✅ **Transplant** (if soil very wet):
   - To fresh dry soil
   - With better drainage (perlite 20-30%)

### Prevention
✅ **Water correctly:**
   - Wait until top layer (1-2 inches / 3-5 cm) completely dry
   - Check with finger or pot weight
   - Seedlings: every 3-5 days
   - Adult plants: every 2-4 days (depends on size)

✅ **Good drainage:**
   - Perlite in soil (20-30%)
   - Holes in pot bottom
   - Tray underneath (drain excess water!)

✅ **Right pot size:**
   - Seedling: 0.5-1 L (0.1-0.25 gal)
   - Veg: 3-7 L (0.8-1.8 gal)
   - Flowering: 11-20 L (3-5 gal)

## Underwatering

### Symptoms
- **Droopy leaves** (hanging, but look "dry", not swollen)
- Leaves curl inward (protection from evaporation)
- Soil dry, hard, pulling from pot edges
- Leaves crispy to touch
- Fast recovery after watering (within 1-2 hours)

### Treatment
✅ Water plant (slowly, so water absorbs)
✅ After 10-15 minutes water again
✅ Plant recovers in 1-2 hours

**Important:** Underwatering less dangerous than overwatering! Plant recovers in hours.

### Prevention
✅ Water when top layer dry (don't wait for complete drying!)
✅ Check pot weight (light = needs water)

## Root Rot

### Symptoms
- **Brown/black/slimy roots** (healthy = white!)
- **Unpleasant rotting smell** from soil
- Leaves wilting (despite watering)
- Leaves yellow, die
- Growth slowing
- Stem at base soft, dark

### Causes
- Overwatering (main!)
- Poor root oxygenation (no air)
- High water temperature (>7gt;75°F / 24°C in hydro)
- Pathogenic fungi (Pythium, Fusarium)

### Treatment

**Light stage (some roots brown):**
1. **Hydrogen peroxide:**
   - 3% H₂O₂: 10 ml per 1 L water
   - Water soil / soak roots 10 min
   - Kills anaerobic bacteria

2. **Transplant:**
   - To fresh soil with better drainage
   - Remove brown roots (clean scissors)

3. **Let dry:**
   - Don't water 5-7 days

**Critical stage (all roots black):**
❌ Plant likely can't be saved
✅ You can try:
   - Cut top (cloning)
   - Transplant to fresh soil + H₂O₂
   - But chances low

### Prevention
✅ Don't overwater
✅ Good drainage (perlite, holes)
✅ Water temperature 64-72°F (18-22°C) in hydro
✅ Air stones in DWC (oxygenation)
✅ Beneficial bacteria (Hydroguard, Great White) — compete with pathogens

## Root Bound (Small Pot)

### Symptoms
- **Roots sticking out drainage holes**
- When removed from pot — roots tight ball (repeat pot shape)
- Growth slowing (roots nowhere to grow)
- Plant dries fast (little soil)
- Frequent deficiencies (little soil = few nutrients)
- Leaves yellow from bottom

### Treatment
✅ **Transplant to bigger pot:**
   - 2-3 sizes larger (3L → 7-11L → 15-20L / 0.8 gal → 2-3 gal → 4-5 gal)
   - Careful with roots (don't damage!)

✅ **Transplant technique:**
   - Water plant 1-2 hours before transplant
   - Flip pot, holding plant
   - Plant in new pot with fresh soil
   - Water

### Prevention
✅ **Right pot sizes:**

| Stage | Pot Size |
|-------|----------|
| Seed/Seedling | 0.5-1 L (0.1-0.25 gal) |
| Early Veg | 3-5 L (0.8-1.3 gal) |
| Late Veg | 7-11 L (1.8-3 gal) |
| Flowering | 11-20 L (3-5 gal) |
| Large plants (SCROG) | 20-30 L (5-8 gal) |

✅ **Planned transplanting:**
   - Seedling (2-3 weeks) → 3-5 L (0.8-1.3 gal)
   - Veg (4-5 weeks) → 11-20 L (3-5 gal) (final pot)

## Root Damage

### Causes
- Rough transplanting
- Transplanting at wrong time (start of flowering)
- Mechanical damage when loosening soil
- Pests (fungus gnats eat roots)

### Symptoms
- Wilting after transplant (longer than 24-48 hours)
- Growth slowing
- Leaves yellow

### Treatment
✅ Let plant recover (7-14 days)
✅ Don't overfeed (1/2 dose nutrients)
✅ Maintain optimal conditions
✅ Root stimulators (optional)

### Prevention
✅ Transplant carefully
✅ Best time to transplant: early veg
✅ Don't transplant during flowering (unless critical)

## Healthy Roots: What They Look Like

### Healthy Root Signs

✅ **Color:** White, light beige
✅ **Structure:** Many thin hairs (root hairs)
✅ **Smell:** Neutral, earthy (not rotting!)
✅ **Texture:** Firm, not slimy

### How to Check Roots (without removing from pot)

1. **Pot weight:**
   - Heavy after watering = good
   - Quickly becomes light = root bound (little soil)

2. **Drainage holes:**
   - Roots NOT sticking out = good
   - Roots sticking out = time to transplant

3. **Plant condition:**
   - Healthy growth = roots fine
   - Slowing + yellowing = check roots

## Growie's Advice

Overwatering is beginner mistake #1! Rule: better underwater than overwater. Water only when top layer (1-2 inches / 3-5 cm) completely dry — check with finger every time. If you're unsure whether to water or not — wait a day. In Growie, log watering frequency (every 2 days? 3 days?) — after a couple weeks you'll find perfect interval for your conditions. And remember: brown roots = root rot = can kill plant, act immediately (transplant + H₂O₂)!
