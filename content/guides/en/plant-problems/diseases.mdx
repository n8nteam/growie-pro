# Cannabis Diseases: Mold, Rot, and Fungi

![Plant diseases](/images/guides/plant-diseases.jpg)

Fungal diseases are the main threat during flowering. One moldy bud can infect entire harvest. Prevention is critical!

## Powdery Mildew (PM)

### Signs
- **White powdery coating** on leaves (looks like flour)
- Starts on lower leaves
- Spreads upward quickly
- Leaves yellow, die

### Causes
- High humidity (>70% RH) + poor circulation
- Spores from outside (clothes, air)
- Temperature swings (day/night)

### Treatment

**Early stage:**
1. **Milk solution:**
   - 100 ml milk to 900 ml water (1:9)
   - Spray affected leaves
   - Repeat every 3 days

2. **Baking soda:**
   - 1 tsp soda to 1 L water + 2-3 drops liquid soap
   - Spray leaves
   - Every 5-7 days

**Critical stage:**
- Remove all affected leaves
- Fungicides (veg stage only!)
- During flowering: milk, soda, or cut affected parts

### Prevention
✅ Humidity <60% during flowering
✅ Excellent circulation (fans)
✅ Stable temperature (no swings)
✅ Remove lower leaves (improves circulation)

## Bud Rot / Botrytis (Gray Mold)

### Signs
- **Gray/brown mold INSIDE buds**
- Not visible outside at first
- Bud becomes soft, dark
- Unpleasant musty smell
- Leaves around bud yellow, easily pull off

**Critical:** Spreads VERY fast! Can infect all buds in 3-5 days!

### Causes
- High humidity (>60% RH) during flowering
- Dense buds (indicas) + poor circulation
- Bud damage (caterpillars, mechanical)
- Cold nights + humid days

### Treatment
❌ **NO cure!** Only removal.

**Actions:**
1. **Immediately cut affected bud** (with 2-4 inch / 5-10 cm margin of healthy tissue)
2. **DON'T touch other buds** (spores spread!)
3. **Inspect ALL buds** (especially dense, thick ones)
4. **Lower humidity** to 40-45% RH
5. **Increase circulation** (more fans)
6. **Consider early harvest** (if infection severe)

**Important:** Don't smoke moldy buds! Dangerous to health.

### Prevention
✅ **Humidity 40-50% during flowering** (critical!)
✅ Excellent air circulation
✅ Defoliation (remove leaves inside buds)
✅ Inspect buds daily (especially thick ones)
✅ Avoid mechanical damage

## Root Rot

### Signs
- **Brown, slimy roots** (healthy = white!)
- Unpleasant rotting smell
- Leaves wilting (despite watering)
- Growth slowing
- Leaves yellow, die

### Causes
- **Overwatering** (main cause!)
- High water temperature (>75°F / 24°C in hydro)
- Poor root oxygenation
- Pathogenic fungi (Pythium, Fusarium)

### Treatment

**Soil:**
1. Let soil **completely dry** (3-7 days no watering)
2. Transplant to fresh soil (if critical)
3. Treat roots with hydrogen peroxide:
   - 3% H₂O₂: 10 ml per 1 L water
   - Water soil or soak roots 10 minutes

**Hydroponics:**
1. Change solution
2. Add peroxide: 3 ml/L of 3% H₂O₂
3. Cool water to 64-68°F (18-20°C)
4. Add air stone (more oxygen)
5. Use Hydroguard or beneficial bacteria (Bacillus)

### Prevention
✅ Don't overwater (good drainage)
✅ Water temperature 64-72°F (18-22°C) in hydro
✅ Root oxygenation (air stones in DWC)
✅ Beneficial bacteria (Hydroguard, Great White)

## Fusarium Wilt

### Signs
- Sudden **wilting** (despite watering)
- Leaves yellow on one side of plant
- Stem when cut **brown inside** (vessels clogged)
- Doesn't recover after watering

### Causes
- Fusarium fungus in soil
- Enters through root damage
- High soil temperature (>79°F / 26°C)

### Treatment
❌ **NO cure!** Plant will die.

**Actions:**
1. Isolate plant (to not infect others)
2. Remove plant with soil
3. Disinfect pot and tools (10% bleach)
4. DON'T reuse this soil

### Prevention
✅ Sterile soil
✅ Don't damage roots when transplanting
✅ Soil temperature <79°F (26°C)
✅ Beneficial bacteria (compete with Fusarium)

## Septoria Leaf Spot

### Signs
- **Yellow spots** with brown center on lower leaves
- Spots with dark border
- Leaves yellow, die from bottom up

### Causes
- High humidity + poor circulation
- Spores in soil (especially outdoor)

### Treatment
- Remove affected leaves
- Fungicides (veg stage only)
- Lower humidity, improve circulation

---

## General Disease Control Rules

### Prevention — 90% Success

✅ **Humidity:**
- Veg: 50-70%
- Flowering: 40-50% (critical!)
- Last 2 weeks: 35-45%

✅ **Air circulation:**
- Minimum 2 fans in tent
- Air should flow through plants
- Exhaust runs 24/7

✅ **Temperature:**
- Optimal: 68-79°F (20-26°C)
- Avoid swings (day/night <18°F / 10°C)

✅ **Defoliation:**
- Remove lower leaves (don't get light)
- Remove leaves inside dense buds (circulation)

✅ **Cleanliness:**
- Wash hands before work
- Sterilize tools (alcohol)
- Don't bring plants/flowers from outside

✅ **Inspection:**
- Check plants EVERY day
- Especially inside buds (bud rot)

### What to do when discovered

1. **Isolate** infected plant (if possible)
2. **Remove** affected parts (with margin)
3. **Lower humidity** to minimum
4. **Increase circulation**
5. **Treat** (milk, soda, fungicides in veg)
6. **Don't panic**, but act fast!

## Growie's Advice

Diseases during flowering = crop loss! Only protection is prevention. Keep humidity 40-50% RH last 6 weeks of flowering, good circulation, inspect buds daily. If you find bud rot — cut affected bud IMMEDIATELY, don't wait! In Growie, log humidity every day, especially during flowering — if you see >55% several days in a row → turn on dehumidifier. And remember: one moldy bud can infect entire harvest in a week!
