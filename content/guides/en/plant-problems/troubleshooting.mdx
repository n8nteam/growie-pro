# Identifying and Solving Problems

![Troubleshooting](/images/guides/troubleshooting.jpg)

Every grower faces problems. The key is to recognize them early and respond correctly.

## Nutrient Deficiencies

### Nitrogen (N)
- **Symptoms**: lower leaves turn yellow and drop, pale green color
- **Fix**: increase Grow nutrient dose, check pH

### Phosphorus (P)
- **Symptoms**: dark spots on leaves, purple stems, slow growth
- **Fix**: increase Bloom nutrient dose, ensure pH < 7.0

### Potassium (K)
- **Symptoms**: brown leaf edges, tip burn
- **Fix**: add potassium supplement, check EC

### Calcium (Ca)
- **Symptoms**: brown spots on new leaves, distorted growth
- **Fix**: add CalMag, especially important with coco

### Magnesium (Mg)
- **Symptoms**: interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins)
- **Fix**: CalMag or Epsom salt

### Iron (Fe)
- **Symptoms**: new leaves fully yellow with green veins
- **Fix**: lower pH to 6.0-6.3, add chelated iron

## Nutrient Excess

### Signs of Overfeeding
- Dark green leaves
- "Clawing" — leaf tips curl downward
- Dry, burned edges
- Nutrient lockout

### Solution
1. Flush medium with plain pH'd water
2. Skip 1-2 feedings
3. Resume at half strength

## Root Zone Issues

### Overwatering
- **Symptoms**: drooping leaves, slow growth, wet medium
- **Fix**: let it dry out, improve drainage, water less frequently

### Root Rot
- **Symptoms**: brown, slimy roots, bad smell
- **Fix**: treat with hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), improve aeration

## Pests

### Spider Mites
- **Signs**: tiny dots on leaves, webbing
- **Fix**: insecticidal soap, Neem oil

### Fungus Gnats
- **Signs**: small flies near soil, larvae in medium
- **Fix**: let medium dry out, sticky traps, Bacillus thuringiensis drench

### Thrips
- **Signs**: silvery trails on leaves
- **Fix**: sticky traps, spinosad

## Diseases

### Powdery Mildew
- **Signs**: white powder on leaves
- **Fix**: improve ventilation, lower humidity, milk solution spray (1:9)

### Bud Rot (Botrytis)
- **Signs**: gray mold on buds, especially dense ones
- **Fix**: remove affected areas, lower humidity to 40%, improve airflow

## Environmental Stress

### Light Burn
- **Signs**: bleached, white tops
- **Fix**: raise the light, reduce intensity

### Heat Stress
- **Signs**: leaves "taco" — curling upward at edges
- **Fix**: lower temperature, improve ventilation

### Wind Stress
- **Signs**: clawing on leaves near the fan
- **Fix**: redirect fan, reduce speed
