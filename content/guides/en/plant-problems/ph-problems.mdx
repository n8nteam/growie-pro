# pH Problems and Nutrient Lockout

![pH problems](/images/guides/ph-problems.jpg)

**80% of nutrient problems happen because of wrong pH!** Even if nutrients are sufficient, plants won't absorb them at wrong pH. This is called nutrient lockout.

## What is pH

**pH** — measure of acidity/alkalinity (scale 0-14).

- **pH 7.0** — neutral
- **pH &lt;7.0** — acidic
- **pH &gt;7.0** — alkaline

**For plants:**
pH determines which nutrients can be absorbed by roots.

## Optimal pH for Cannabis

### Soil

**Optimal:** 6.0-6.5 (slightly acidic)

**Acceptable:** 5.8-7.0

**Critical:**
- &lt;5.5 → blocks N, P, K, Ca, Mg
- &gt;7.5 → blocks Fe, Mn, Zn, B

### Hydroponics / Coco

**Optimal:** 5.8-6.2 (more acidic than soil!)

**Acceptable:** 5.5-6.5

**Critical:**
- &lt;5.0 → micronutrient toxicity
- &gt;6.8 → blocks Fe, Mn, P

### Why different pH?

**Soil:**
- Contains organic matter that buffers pH
- Needs slightly higher pH for all element availability

**Hydro/coco:**
- Inert mediums without buffer
- Needs lower pH for optimal absorption

## Nutrient Uptake Table by pH

### Soil

| Element | Optimal pH |
|---------|------------|
| Nitrogen (N) | 6.0-7.0 |
| Phosphorus (P) | 6.0-7.0 |
| Potassium (K) | 6.0-7.0 |
| Calcium (Ca) | 6.2-7.0 |
| Magnesium (Mg) | 6.5-7.0 |
| Iron (Fe) | 5.5-6.5 |
| Manganese (Mn) | 5.5-6.5 |
| Zinc (Zn) | 5.5-7.0 |

**Conclusion:** pH 6.0-6.5 is ideal for all elements.

### Hydro/Coco

| Element | Optimal pH |
|---------|------------|
| Nitrogen (N) | 5.5-6.5 |
| Phosphorus (P) | 5.5-6.5 |
| Potassium (K) | 5.5-6.5 |
| Calcium (Ca) | 6.0-6.5 |
| Magnesium (Mg) | 6.0-6.5 |
| Iron (Fe) | 5.0-6.0 |
| Manganese (Mn) | 5.0-6.0 |

**Conclusion:** pH 5.8-6.2 is ideal.

## Wrong pH Symptoms

### pH too low (<5lt;5.5 soil, &lt;5.0 hydro)

**Symptoms:**
- **Micronutrient toxicity** (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu)
- Brown spots on leaves
- Tip necrosis (dying)
- Growth slowing
- Roots brown (not white)

**Why:**
Micronutrients become too available → plant absorbs excess → toxicity.

### pH too high (>7gt;7.0 soil, &gt;6.5 hydro)

**Symptoms:**
- **Iron, manganese, phosphorus deficiency**
- New leaves yellow with green veins (Fe)
- Interveinal chlorosis on new leaves (Mn)
- Purple stems (P)
- Growth slowing

**Why:**
These elements "precipitate" (bind into insoluble forms) → plant can't absorb them.

### Nutrient Lockout (Complete Block)

**Symptoms:**
- **Simultaneously** signs of **multiple deficiencies**
- Yellow leaves + brown spots + edge necrosis
- Doesn't respond to feeding (even correct!)
- Rapid deterioration

**Cause:**
pH strongly outside optimal → most elements blocked.

**Critical:** Can kill plant in 1-2 weeks!

## How to Measure pH

### pH Meter (electronic)

**Price:** $15-50

**Pros:**
✅ Accurate (±0.1 pH)
✅ Fast result (seconds)
✅ Reusable

**Cons:**
❌ Requires calibration (once a month)
❌ Batteries
❌ Fragile sensor

**Recommendations:**
- Apera PH20 ($50) — accurate, reliable
- Budget from AliExpress ($10-15) — work, but less accurate

**How to calibrate:**
1. Buy calibration solutions pH 4.0 and 7.0 ($10)
2. Calibrate monthly per instructions

### pH Strips / Drops

**Price:** $5-10

**Pros:**
✅ Cheap
✅ Don't require calibration

**Cons:**
❌ Less accurate (±0.5 pH)
❌ Single-use

**When to use:**
For beginners or checking soil (pH meter for liquids).

## How to Correct pH

### To lower pH (if too high)

**pH Down (acid):**
- Phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) — standard
- Or citric acid (organic)

**How to use:**
1. Mix nutrients in water
2. Measure solution pH
3. Add pH Down **drop by drop**, stir
4. Check pH after each drop
5. Goal: 6.0-6.5 (soil) or 5.8-6.2 (hydro)

**Important:** Add slowly! Easy to overdo.

### To raise pH (if too low)

**pH Up (alkali):**
- Potassium hydroxide (KOH) — standard
- Or baking soda (sodium bicarbonate)

**How to use:**
Same as pH Down, but adding pH Up.

### How much needed?

**Depends on:**
- Water hardness (soft water — less buffer, pH changes easier)
- Nutrients (some lower pH, others raise it)

**Guide:**
- Usually 1-2 ml pH Down per 10 liters water (2.5 gal)
- But always check!

## How to Measure Soil pH

### Runoff Method

**Most accurate for soil/coco:**

1. **Water plant:**
   - Water pH 6.0-6.5
   - Volume: 20-30% of pot volume
2. **Collect runoff:**
   - Water drained from pot
3. **Measure runoff pH:**
   - This is real pH in root zone!

**What it means:**
- Runoff pH = soil pH
- If runoff pH very different from solution pH → soil buffering that direction

**Example:**
- Watered pH 6.2
- Runoff pH 5.5
- Means soil acidified → need to water pH 6.5-7.0 to raise

### Medium Method (for hydro/coco)

**For hydroponics:**
Just measure solution pH in reservoir.

**For coco:**
Use runoff method (above).

## Correcting Soil pH

### If soil pH too low (<5lt;5.5)

**Solution:**

1. **Flush soil:**
   - Water pH 7.0
   - Volume: 2-3x pot size
2. **Water with pH 6.5-7.0 solution:**
   - Next 2-3 waterings
3. **Check runoff pH:**
   - Goal: 6.0-6.5

**Long-term:**
- Add dolomite lime to soil when transplanting
- Buffers pH (prevents acidification)

### If soil pH too high (>7gt;7.0)

**Solution:**

1. **Flush soil:**
   - Water pH 5.5
   - Volume: 2-3x pot size
2. **Water with pH 6.0 solution:**
   - Next 2-3 waterings
3. **Check runoff pH:**
   - Goal: 6.0-6.5

**Long-term:**
- Add sulfur to soil when transplanting
- Lowers pH

## pH Drift

### What it is

**pH drift** — pH change in solution/soil over time.

**Causes:**
1. **Soil bacteria** release acids → pH drops
2. **Water evaporation** → salt concentration rises → pH changes
3. **Plant uptake** of different elements → pH changes

**In hydroponics:**
- pH usually rises (drift up)
- Need to correct daily

**In soil:**
- pH usually drops (drift down)
- Need to check weekly

### How to control

**Hydro:**
✅ Check reservoir pH daily
✅ Correct with pH Down/Up as needed

**Soil:**
✅ Check runoff pH weekly
✅ Correct watering solution pH if needed

## pH Problem Prevention

### Checklist

✅ **Buy pH meter** ($15-50) — mandatory!

✅ **Check pH every watering:**
- Measure solution pH with nutrients
- Adjust to 6.0-6.5 (soil) or 5.8-6.2 (hydro)

✅ **Check runoff pH:**
- Weekly (soil)
- Daily (hydro)

✅ **pH range, not fixed value:**
- Not always 6.3
- Alternate 6.0 → 6.3 → 6.5 → 6.0
- This way all elements available

✅ **Calibrate pH meter monthly**

✅ **Use buffers:**
- Dolomite lime in soil (stabilizes pH)

✅ **Quality water:**
- Tap water usually pH 7-8
- RO water (reverse osmosis) pH 7.0
- Always adjust!

## Nutrient Lockout: Treatment

**If nutrient lockout happened:**

### Step 1: Flush medium

- Water pH 6.0 (soil) or 5.8 (hydro)
- Volume: 3x pot size
- Check runoff pH (should become 6.0-6.5)

### Step 2: Let dry

- Don't water 3-7 days

### Step 3: Resume feeding

- 1/4 dose nutrients
- Solution pH correct!

### Step 4: Wait

- Recovery: 10-14 days
- New leaves will grow healthy

## Growie's Advice

pH meter is **the most important purchase for a grower!** Without it you're working blind. 80% of nutrient problems solve with simple pH control. Buy a pH meter for $20-50, calibrate monthly, check pH every watering — and forget about deficiencies! In Growie, log pH of every watering and runoff pH — you'll see patterns (e.g., pH drops by end of week → correct in advance). And remember: nutrient lockout from pH is 90% of "mysterious" problems when feeding doesn't help!
