# Nutrient Deficiencies: Diagnosis and Treatment

![Nutrient Deficiencies](/images/guides/nutrient-deficiencies.jpg)

Nutrient deficiencies are one of the most common problems in growing. Learn to recognize the symptoms of each element, and your plants will stay healthy. In this guide — all deficiencies from A to Z.

## How to Identify Deficiencies

### Mobile vs Immobile Elements

**Mobile elements** (plant can relocate them):
- Symptoms appear first on **old lower leaves**
- Plant "pulls" the element from old leaves to feed new growth
- Elements: **N, P, K, Mg, Zn, Mo**

**Immobile elements** (plant cannot relocate):
- Symptoms appear on **new upper leaves**
- Growth stops, deformations occur
- Elements: **Ca, Fe, S, B, Cu, Mn**

### Quick Diagnosis Table

| Where | Color | Likely Deficiency |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| Lower leaves | Yellowing | Nitrogen (N) |
| Lower leaves | Dark spots, purple stems | Phosphorus (P) |
| Lower leaves | Brown edges | Potassium (K) |
| Lower leaves | Interveinal chlorosis (yellow patches) | Magnesium (Mg) |
| Upper leaves | Brown spots, deformation | Calcium (Ca) |
| Upper leaves | Yellow with green veins | Iron (Fe) |
| Upper leaves | Yellowing completely | Sulfur (S) |

## Macronutrients (NPK)

### Nitrogen (N) — Most Common Deficiency

**Role:** Foundation of growth, proteins, chlorophyll. Especially important during vegetation.

#### Nitrogen Deficiency Symptoms

**Early signs:**
- Lower leaves **light green**, fading
- Plant slows growth
- Leaves smaller than usual

**Progressing:**
- Lower leaves **yellow** completely
- Yellowing moves up the plant
- Leaves drop off
- Stems thin, weak

**Critical:**
- Entire plant pale yellow
- Growth almost stopped
- Flowering delayed or doesn't start

**Important:** Slight nitrogen deficiency during flowering is normal! Plant uses reserves for buds.

#### Causes

1. **Low nitrogen in nutrients** (concentration too weak)
2. **Wrong pH** (blocks uptake)
   - Soil: optimal 6.0-7.0
   - Hydro/coco: optimal 5.5-6.5
3. **Vegetative stage without feeding** (plant depleted nitrogen from soil)
4. **Nitrogen leaching** (frequent watering with plain water)

#### Treatment

**Fast (24-48 hours):**
1. **Foliar spray:**
   - Dilute veg nutrients (high N)
   - Concentration: 1/4 of regular dose
   - Spray leaves (bottom and top)
   - Do it in the evening or with lights off
   - Results in 24 hours

**Main treatment (3-7 days):**
1. **Root feeding:**
   - Veg nutrients (N-P-K 3-1-2 or higher N)
   - Full dose per instructions
   - Check pH of solution!

2. **Check pH:**
   - Soil: 6.0-6.5
   - Hydro/coco: 5.8-6.2

**Prevention:**
✅ Regular feeding during veg (every 1-2 waterings)
✅ Don't use Bloom nutrients during veg (low nitrogen!)
✅ Control pH every watering

### Phosphorus (P) — Important for Roots and Flowering

**Role:** Root development, energy exchange, flowering, bud formation.

#### Phosphorus Deficiency Symptoms

**Early:**
- Dark green leaves (excess chlorophyll)
- Slow growth
- Purple/red **stems** (especially on leaf petioles)

**Progressing:**
- **Dark purple or bronze spots** on lower leaves
- Leaves curl downward
- Leaves brittle, fragile
- Flowering start delayed

**Critical:**
- Lower leaves almost black, dying
- Buds small, airy
- Roots weak

**Important:** Purple stems can also be from genetics (some strains) or cold!

#### Causes

1. **Low temperature** (<64°F / 18°C) — phosphorus poorly absorbed
2. **Wrong pH** (especially pH >7.0)
3. **Low phosphorus in nutrients** (using Grow during flowering)
4. **Overwatering** (cold, wet soil = poor absorption)

#### Treatment

**Fast:**
1. **Foliar spray** (results in 2-3 days):
   - Bloom nutrients (high P)
   - 1/4 dose
   - Spray in evening

**Main (5-7 days):**
1. **Root feeding:**
   - Bloom nutrients (N-P-K 1-3-2 or higher P)
   - Full dose

2. **Raise temperature:**
   - Minimum 68°F / 20°C (optimal 72-79°F / 22-26°C)

3. **Check pH:**
   - Soil: 6.2-7.0 (phosphorus better absorbed at pH 6.5+)
   - Hydro/coco: 5.8-6.2

**Prevention:**
✅ Bloom nutrients during flowering
✅ Temperature >68°F / 20°C always
✅ Don't overwater (good drainage)

### Potassium (K) — For Immunity and Dense Buds

**Role:** Water transport, photosynthesis, immunity, bud density.

#### Potassium Deficiency Symptoms

**Early:**
- **Brown edges** on lower leaves ("burn")
- Leaf tips yellowing

**Progressing:**
- Leaf edges **necrotic** (dead, dry, brown)
- Interveinal chlorosis (yellow patches between veins)
- Leaves curl up at edges
- Internodal stretch (long, thin stems)

**Critical:**
- Leaves completely brown, crispy
- Buds airy, small
- Plant weak, susceptible to diseases

**Looks like:** Nutrient burn (overfeeding), but K deficiency starts on lower leaves, while burn starts on tips of all leaves.

#### Causes

1. **Low potassium in nutrients** (especially during flowering)
2. **Wrong pH** (K poorly absorbed at pH <5.5 or >7.0)
3. **Excess calcium or nitrogen** (blocks potassium)
4. **High EC** (overfeeding other elements)

#### Treatment

**Fast:**
1. **Foliar spray** (results in 2-3 days):
   - Bloom booster (high K)
   - 1/4 dose

**Main (5-10 days):**
1. **Root feeding:**
   - PK booster (13/14 or 0-5-4)
   - Or Bloom nutrients with high K

2. **Check pH:**
   - Soil: 6.0-6.5
   - Hydro/coco: 5.8-6.2

3. **Check EC:**
   - If EC high (>2.0) → flush medium with clean water (pH 6.0)
   - Resume feeding at 1/2 dose

**Prevention:**
✅ PK booster last 3-4 weeks of flowering
✅ Don't overfeed nitrogen during flowering
✅ Control pH and EC

## Secondary Macronutrients

### Calcium (Ca) — For Cell Structure

**Role:** Cell wall building material, nutrient transport.

**Important:** Calcium deficiency **very common** under LED lighting and in coco!

#### Calcium Deficiency Symptoms

**Early:**
- **Brown/rusty spots** on **new leaves** (top)
- New leaf deformation (twisted, uneven edges)

**Progressing:**
- New leaves small, misshapen
- Leaf tips die
- Interveinal chlorosis on new leaves
- Stems weak, hollow inside

**Critical:**
- Tops dying
- Buds airy, easily affected by rot (bud rot)
- Roots weak

**Looks like:** Iron deficiency, but Ca has brown spots, Fe has yellow leaves.

#### Causes

1. **Growing in coco** (coco binds calcium)
2. **LED lighting** (plants grow faster → need more Ca)
3. **Low humidity** (<40%) — Ca transported with water
4. **Wrong pH** (Ca poorly absorbed at pH <6.0)
5. **Excess potassium or magnesium** (blocks calcium)

#### Treatment

**Fast (NOT effective for Ca!):**
❌ Foliar feeding of calcium not effective (Ca slowly mobile)

**Main (7-14 days):**
1. **Root feeding:**
   - **CalMag** (calcium + magnesium) — special supplement
   - Dose: 1-2 ml/L water (read instructions)
   - Give with every watering

2. **Raise humidity:**
   - Minimum 50-60% RH (optimal for Ca transport)

3. **Check pH:**
   - Soil: 6.2-7.0 (Ca better absorbed at 6.5+)
   - Hydro/coco: 5.8-6.5

**Prevention:**
✅ Always use CalMag with coco and under LED!
✅ Add CalMag from first week of veg
✅ Maintain humidity 50-60%
✅ pH >6.0

- Looks like "tiger" pattern

**Progressing:**
- Yellow patches expand
- Leaves curl up at edges
- Leaf edges brown (necrosis)
- Chlorosis moves up the plant

**Critical:**
- Lower leaves completely yellow with brown edges

- Growth slowing

**Looks like:** Iron deficiency, but Mg symptoms on lower leaves, Fe on upper.

#### Causes

1. **Growing in coco** (low magnesium in coco)
2. **Excess calcium or potassium** (blocks magnesium)
3. **Wrong pH** (<6.0)
4. **Cold water** (Mg poorly absorbed)

#### Treatment

**Fast (24-48 hours):**
1. **Foliar spray:**
   - CalMag (1/4 dose)
   - Or Epsom Salt (magnesium sulfate): 1 tsp per 1 liter water
   - Spray in evening
   - Results in 1-2 days

**Main (5-7 days):**
1. **Root feeding:**

**Looks like:** Nitrogen deficiency, but nitrogen symptoms on lower leaves, sulfur on upper.

#### Causes

1. **Very rare!** Sulfur present in almost any water and nutrients
2. **Wrong pH** (<6.0 or >7.5)
3. **Reverse osmosis** (RO water without minerals)

#### Treatment

**Main (7-10 days):**
1. **Root feeding:**
   - Epsom Salt (magnesium sulfate = magnesium + sulfur): 1 tsp/L
   - Or any nutrients (usually contain sulfur)

2. **Check pH:**
   - 6.0-7.0

**Prevention:**
✅ Use complete nutrients (always contain sulfur)

- Top stops growing

**Looks like:** Magnesium deficiency, but Fe symptoms on upper leaves.

#### Causes

1. **High pH** (>7.0) — iron blocked!
2. **Excess phosphorus** (blocks iron)
3. **Overwatering** (roots don't absorb Fe)

#### Treatment

**Fast (48-72 hours):**
1. **Foliar spray:**
   - Iron chelate (Fe-DTPA or Fe-EDDHA)

**Main (5-7 days):**
1. **Lower pH:**
   - Soil: 6.0-6.5
   - Hydro/coco: 5.5-6.0
   - This is key!

2. **Root feeding:**
   - Iron chelate to medium

**Prevention:**
✅ Control pH (not above 6.5 in soil!)
✅ Don't overfeed phosphorus

## Deficiency Diagnosis Checklist

### Step 1: Where are symptoms?

- **Lower old leaves** → Mobile element (N, P, K, Mg, Zn)
- **Upper new leaves** → Immobile element (Ca, Fe, S, B, Mn)

### Step 2: What color?

- **Yellow** → N (lower), Fe (upper), Mg (interveinal, lower), S (upper)
- **Brown edges** → K (lower), Ca (upper, spots)
- **Dark spots** → P, Ca
- **Purple stems** → P (or cold/genetics)

### Step 3: Check pH!

**80% of deficiencies due to wrong pH!**

- Soil: 6.0-6.5
- Hydro/coco: 5.8-6.2

### Step 4: Check EC

- If EC low (<1.0) → underfeeding
- If EC high (>2.0) → overfeeding (blocks absorption)

### Step 5: Treatment

1. Correct pH
2. Feed needed element
3. Foliar spray for fast effect
4. Wait 5-7 days

## Growie's Advice

90% of deficiencies are easily avoided: control pH every watering, use CalMag under LED and in coco, don't overfeed! If you see a deficiency — first check pH, don't rush to buy new nutrients. In Growie, log every problem: what symptoms, what pH was, how you treated it, how many days to recovery — after a few cycles you'll recognize deficiencies instantly! And remember: better underfeed than overfeed — deficiency corrects in a week, while burn (overfeeding) can kill the plant!
