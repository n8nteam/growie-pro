# Revegetation: Return to Veg After Flowering

![Revegetation](/images/guides/revegetation.jpg)

Revegetation (re-veg) is returning a plant from flowering back to vegetative stage. Harvested but want to save genetics? Revegetate! Plant will grow new branches you can take clones from. Process is complex (3-8 weeks), but sometimes it's the only way to save rare genetics.

## What is Revegetation?

**Definition:**
- Plant was flowering (12/12)
- You return it to vegetative light schedule (18/6 or 24/0)
- Plant "wakes up" and starts growing again
- New branches and leaves grow

**How it works:**
- Plant "thought" autumn came (12/12 = short day)
- You "trick" it by returning summer schedule (18/6)
- Plant switches back to growth (instead of flowering)

## Why Revegetation Needed?

### Main Reasons

**1. Save rare/perfect genetics:**
- Grew from seeds, loved result (taste, potency, yield)
- But didn't take clones before flowering
- Revegetate → take clones → make mother

**2. Second harvest from same plant:**
- Harvested
- Revegetate → new branches grow
- Flower again

**3. Emergency genetics saving:**
- Mother plant died
- Clones didn't root
- Last chance: revegetate flowering plant

### When NOT to Revegetate?

❌ **Autoflowers:**
- Can't revegetate (flower by age, not light)

❌ **Plant in bad condition:**
- Sick, pests, heavily stressed
- Better to grow new from seeds

❌ **Have clones/seeds of same genetics:**
- Revegetation takes long (3-8 weeks)
- Easier to grow clone/seed

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Harvest

**What to leave:**

✅ **Lower branches with leaves:**
- Leave 3-5 lower branches (4-6 in / 10-15 cm each)
- Branches must have healthy leaves (green)
- Leaves = energy for revegetation

✅ **Some small buds:**
- Leave small buds on lower branches
- They contain growth hormones

**Don't cut to ground!**
- If cut everything → revegetation takes 6-8 weeks (or won't work)
- If leave branches → 3-5 weeks

---

### Step 2: Pruning

**What to prune:**

✅ **Top:**
- Cut all top buds (harvesting them)

✅ **Large fan leaves:**
- Remove yellowed/dead leaves
- Keep green healthy ones

✅ **Roots (optional):**
- If roots filled entire pot:
- Remove plant, cut 20-30% of lower roots
- Transplant to fresh soil

---

### Step 3: Change Light Schedule

**Transition:**
- From 12/12 (flower) → 18/6 or 24/0 (veg)

**Recommendation: 18/6**
- Plant rests in darkness
- Less stress

**Can do 24/0:**
- Faster revegetation (1-2 weeks quicker)
- But more stress

**Lighting:**
- Vegetative spectrum (blue/white)
- LED 100-200W or CFL/T5 100-150W

---

### Step 4: Conditions

**Temperature:**
- Day: 72-79°F (22-26°C)
- Night: 64-72°F (18-22°C, if 18/6)

**Humidity:**
- 60-70% (higher than flowering)
- Helps new leaves grow

**Watering:**
- Less than flowering!
- Root system large but few leaves
- Water when top 2 inches (5 cm) of soil dry

**Feeding:**
- Vegetative nutrients (more nitrogen)
- 50% of normal dose (first 2 weeks)
- Then 75-100%

---

### Step 5: Wait (3-8 weeks)

**Week 1-2: "Shock"**
- Plant in shock (sudden conditions change)
- Leaves may yellow/fall
- This is normal!
- Don't panic, don't change conditions

**Week 3-4: "Awakening"**
- Small green dots appear (new leaves)
- On branches, in leaf axils, at buds
- New leaves weird shape (1-3 fingers instead of 5-7)
- This is normal! It's sign of revegetation!

**Week 5-8: "Growth"**
- New leaves become normal (5-7 fingers)
- New branches grow (2-4 in / 5-10 cm)
- Plant fully in veg!

**Time depends on:**
- How many leaves left (more = faster)
- Strain (indica faster, sativa slower)
- Conditions (optimal = faster)

---

### Step 6: What to Do Next?

**Option 1: Take Clones**

✅ **When to take:**
- New branches 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) long
- Healthy green leaves (5-7 fingers)

✅ **How to take:**
- Cut at 45° angle
- Rooting hormone (Clonex)
- Like regular cloning

**Option 2: Make Mother Plant**

✅ **How:**
- Keep plant on 18/6 permanently
- Prune for shape (like regular mother)
- Take clones every 2-3 weeks

**Option 3: Second Flowering**

✅ **How:**
- Give plant 4-6 weeks veg (build mass)
- Switch to 12/12
- Plant will flower again

⚠️ **Yield will be lower than first time:**
- Plant stressed
- Roots old
- Expect 60-80% of first harvest

## Problems and Solutions

### Plant Doesn't Revegetate (4+ weeks, no new leaves)

**Causes:**

1. **Too few leaves left:**
   - Cut almost everything → no energy for growth

   **Solution:**
   - Wait another 2-4 weeks
   - Or: discard, grow new from seeds

2. **Bad conditions:**
   - Cold (< 64°F / 18°C)
   - Insufficient light

   **Solution:**
   - Raise temperature (72-79°F / 22-26°C)
   - Increase light (LED 100-200W)

3. **Root system damaged:**
   - Roots rotted or dried out

   **Solution:**
   - Transplant to fresh soil
   - Check watering (moist but not wet)

---

### New Leaves Deformed (1-3 fingers, weird shape)

**This is normal!**
- First leaves after revegetation always weird
- After 2-3 weeks normal ones appear (5-7 fingers)

**Solution:** Just wait. Don't change conditions.

---

### Plant Flowered Again (pistils appeared)

**Causes:**

1. **Light schedule disrupted:**
   - Was less than 18 hours light
   - Or: light leaked during dark period

   **Solution:**
   - Return to 18/6 or 24/0
   - Check timer
   - Isolate from light during dark period

2. **Autoflower:**
   - Plant flowers by age (not light)

   **Solution:**
   - Autoflowers can't revegetate
   - Harvest, grow new from seeds

---

### Leaves Yellowing and Falling

**If first 2 weeks:**
- This is normal! Plant drops old leaves

**If ALL leaves yellow:**

**Causes:**
- Overwatering (watering too much)
- Nitrogen deficiency

**Solution:**
- Check watering (top 2 in / 5 cm should be dry)
- Feed with vegetative nutrients (nitrogen)

## Revegetation vs Cloning

**When revegetation better:**
✅ Didn't take clones before flowering
✅ Unique genetics (no seeds, no clones)
✅ Want second harvest from same plant

**When cloning better:**
✅ Have mother plant
✅ Faster (clone roots in 7-14 days)
✅ Plant in veg is healthy

| Parameter | Revegetation | Cloning |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Time | 3-8 weeks | 7-14 days |
| Difficulty | Hard | Medium |
| Success | 70-90% | 80-95% |
| When to use | After flowering | During veg |

## Tips for Success

**1. Leave more leaves:**
- More green leaves → faster revegetation
- Leave 3-5 lower branches (4-6 in / 10-15 cm)

**2. Don't touch first 3-4 weeks:**
- Plant in shock, don't stress it
- Don't transplant, don't feed (only water)

**3. Use 24/0 if rushing:**
- 1-2 weeks faster than 18/6
- But more electricity

**4. Be patient:**
- Revegetation is slow process
- 3-8 weeks is normal
- Don't give up early!

**5. Second flowering = lower yield:**
- Expect 60-80% of first harvest
- Plant stressed, roots old
- But genetics same!

## Revegetation Alternatives

### 1. Clone During Flowering

**Method:**
- Take clone from flowering plant
- Root (14-21 days, slower than usual)
- Clone automatically revegetates

**Pros:**
- Faster than revegetating whole plant
- Don't need to keep large plant in veg

**Cons:**
- Low success rate (30-50%)
- Long (14-21 days + 2-4 weeks revegetation)

---

### 2. Buy New Seeds

**When suitable:**
- Genetics not unique (can buy again)
- Revegetation takes 6-8 weeks (too long)

---

### 3. Genetics Storage (tissue culture)

**Method:**
- Professional method (tissue culture)
- Genetics stored in test tube (sterile environment)
- Can store for years

**For:**
- Commercial growers, genetic banks
- Difficult for home grower

## Common Questions

### Can You Revegetate Autoflowers?

❌ **No!**
- Autoflowers flower by age (not light schedule)
- Even if return to 18/6 → plant continues flowering and dies

### How Many Times Can You Revegetate One Plant?

**Theoretically:** infinitely

**Practically:**
- 1-2 times no problem
- After 3+ times genetics may degrade
- Plant becomes weaker, yield lower

**Better:**
- Revegetate once → take clones → make new mother

### Can You Revegetate Only Part of Plant?

✅ **Yes!**

**Method:**
- Harvest top buds
- Leave lower branches (4-6 in / 10-15 cm) on plant
- Return to 18/6
- Lower branches revegetate

**Pros:**
- Get harvest + revegetation simultaneously

### When to Take Clones from Revegetated Plant?

**Wait until:**
✅ New branches 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) long
✅ Leaves normal shape (5-7 fingers, not 1-3)
✅ Plant actively growing (new leaf every 3-5 days)

**Usually:** 5-8 weeks after starting revegetation

## Growie's Tip

Revegetation is insurance for those who forgot to take clones! My advice: ALWAYS take 2-3 clones before flowering (even if don't plan to use). But if you found perfect plant in flowering — revegetate. It's long (4-6 weeks average), but works in 80-90% of cases. Key to success: leave 3-5 lower branches with leaves (more green → faster). First 2-3 weeks will be scary: leaves yellow, fall, plant looks dead — don't give up! Then suddenly small green dots appear (new leaves) and you realize: it's working! In Growie, keep revegetation diary: when started, when new leaves appeared, how many weeks it took. After 1-2 times you'll understand your system. And remember: revegetation is plan B. Plan A — always take clones before flowering!
