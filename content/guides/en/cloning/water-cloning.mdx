# Water Cloning: The Simplest Method

![Water Cloning](/images/guides/water-cloning.jpg)

Water cloning is the simplest and cheapest method for beginners. You only need: water, glass, blade. Cut a clone, put it in water, wait 2-3 weeks — done!

## The Method

**How it works:**
1. Cut clone from mother plant
2. Place in glass of water
3. After 14-21 days roots grow
4. Transplant to soil

**Simplicity:** 10/10 (can't be simpler)
**Speed:** 6/10 (slower than other methods)
**Success:** 6/10 (beginners 40-60%, experienced 60-80%)

## What You Need

### Essential

1. **Glass/jar:**
   - Transparent (to see roots)
   - Volume 7-17 oz (200-500 ml)

2. **Water:**
   - pH 5.5-6.0
   - Room temperature (68-77°F / 20-25°C)
   - Dechlorinated (let sit 24 hours)

3. **Sharp blade:**
   - Sterile! (clean with alcohol)
   - Razor or sharp knife

4. **Mother plant:**
   - Healthy, in vegetation
   - Minimum 4-6 weeks growth

### Optional (increases success)

5. **Rooting hormones:**
   - Clonex Gel, Root Riot Gel
   - Will increase success to 70-80%

6. **Aluminum foil:**
   - Wrap glass (protect from light)
   - Light = algae in water

7. **Aquarium heater:**
   - Maintain water 72-75°F (22-24°C)
   - Optional, but helps

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Preparation

**1.1 Prepare water**
- Pour water into glass
- Let sit 24 hours (chlorine evaporation)
- Check pH (5.5-6.0)

**1.2 Prepare tools**
- Clean blade with alcohol
- Prepare glass
- Prepare rooting hormone (if available)

**1.3 Prepare location**
- Low light (CFL 20-40W)
- Temperature 68-77°F (20-25°C)
- Quiet place (don't touch for 2 weeks!)

### Step 2: Choose Cutting

**Which branch to cut:**
✅ Lower/middle branches (not top!)
✅ Thickness: pencil-sized
✅ Length: 4-6 inches (10-15 cm / 4-6 nodes)
✅ Healthy, no damage

**Don't cut:**
❌ Top (that's topping, not cloning)
❌ Weak, thin branches
❌ Branches with signs of disease

---

### Step 3: Cut Clone

**Cutting technique:**

1. **At 45° angle:**
   - Larger cut surface = better water absorption
   - With sharp blade (not scissors!)

2. **Between nodes:**
   - Cut 0.2 inch (5 mm) below node
   - Node has growth hormones

3. **Quickly into water:**
   - Immediately after cutting place in glass
   - Don't let cut dry out!

**Process cutting:**

4. **Remove lower leaves:**
   - Keep 2-3 top fan leaves
   - Lower leaves shouldn't touch water

5. **Trim top leaves:**
   - Cut leaves by 50% (optional)
   - Reduces moisture loss
   - Clone focuses on roots

---

### Step 4: Hormone Treatment (optional)

**If using hormones:**

1. Dip cut in gel (Clonex)
2. For 1-2 seconds
3. Immediately place in water

**Why:**
- Speeds rooting by 3-5 days
- Increases success by 20-30%

---

### Step 5: Placement

**How to place:**

1. **In glass:**
   - Clone stands in water
   - Cut submerged 1-2 inches (3-5 cm)
   - Leaves don't touch water!

2. **Protect from light:**
   - Wrap glass in foil or paper
   - Light → algae → bad for roots

3. **Location:**
   - Low light
   - 18-24 hours light
   - Away from powerful lamps

---

### Step 6: Care

**First 7 days:**

📅 **Every day:**
- Check water level
- Top up as it evaporates

📅 **Every 3-5 days:**
- Change water completely
- Clean water = fewer bacteria

**Don't:**
❌ Don't touch clone
❌ Don't move glass
❌ Don't transplant too early

**Days 8-21:**

🔍 **Watch for roots:**
- Roots appear after 10-14 days
- Small white dots on cut = beginning!
- Wait until roots grow to 0.8-2 inches (2-5 cm)

---

### Step 7: Transplant

**When to transplant:**
✅ Roots 0.8-2 inches (2-5 cm) long
✅ Minimum 3-5 roots
✅ Roots white, healthy

**How to transplant:**

1. **Prepare pot:**
   - Small pot (0.5-1 liter)
   - Light soil (50% perlite)

2. **Make hole:**
   - In center of pot
   - Depth = root length

3. **Carefully transplant:**
   - Roots in water are fragile!
   - Don't pull, don't bend

4. **Water:**
   - Lightly (roots already wet)
   - pH 6.0-6.5

5. **Acclimation:**
   - First 3-5 days low light
   - Gradually increase intensity

## Conditions for Success

### Water

**pH:**
- 5.5-6.0 (optimal 5.8)

**Temperature:**
- 68-75°F (20-24°C)
- Below 64°F (18°C) = slow rooting
- Above 82°F (28°C) = bacteria, rot

**Quality:**
- Dechlorinated (let sit 24 hours)
- Or distilled
- Or RO water

---

### Lighting

**Intensity:**
- Low! CFL 20-40W or LED 50-100W
- Distance: 12-20 inches (30-50 cm) from clone
- Bright light = unnecessary stress

**Schedule:**
- 18-24 hours light
- 24/0 better for roots (no darkness)

---

### Humidity

**Air:**
- 70-90% humidity
- Optional: cover glass with transparent bag

**Leaves:**
- Spray 1-2 times daily
- With clean water (pH 6.0)

## Success Rates

**Typical results:**

| Experience | Without hormones | With hormones |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| Beginner | 40-50% | 60-70% |
| Intermediate | 60-70% | 70-80% |
| Experienced | 70-80% | 80-90% |

**Why not 100%:**
- Poor cutting technique
- Infection (non-sterile tools)
- Wrong conditions (temperature, light)
- Weak mother plant

## Problems and Solutions

### Clone Yellowing After 3-5 Days

**Causes:**
- Normal! Clone loses lower leaves
- Clone focuses on roots

**Solution:**
- Do nothing
- If ALL leaves yellow → problem
- Check light (possibly too bright)

---

### Water Turns Green (algae)

**Causes:**
- Too much light on glass

**Solution:**
- Wrap glass in foil/paper
- Change water

---

### Roots Don't Grow 21+ Days

**Causes:**
- Wrong water temperature
- Bad cut (infection)
- Weak mother plant

**Solution:**
- Check temperature (68-75°F / 20-24°C)
- Use rooting hormones
- Try new cutting

---

### Stem Rots

**Causes:**
- Bacterial infection
- Water too warm (82°F+ / 28°C+)

**Solution:**
- Discard clone (can't save)
- Sterilize glass
- Next time: cleaner tools, cooler water

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

✅ **Free:** only need water and glass
✅ **Simple:** any beginner can do it
✅ **See roots:** can track progress
✅ **No mess:** clean, no soil

### Cons

❌ **Slower:** 14-21 days (other methods 7-14)
❌ **Weak roots:** water roots are fragile, transplanting harder
❌ **Lower success:** 40-70% (aerocloner 90-100%)
❌ **Need experience:** transplanting requires care

## Comparison with Other Methods

| Parameter | Water | Soil | Rapid Rooter | Aerocloner |
|-----------|-------|------|--------------|------------|
| Cost | $0 | $5 | $10-20 | $50-200 |
| Speed | 14-21 days | 10-14 days | 7-10 days | 5-10 days |
| Success (beginner) | 40-60% | 60-70% | 70-80% | 80-90% |
| Difficulty | Easy | Medium | Medium | Hard |
| For | Beginners | All | All | Pros |

## Tips for Success

1. **Sterility is everything:**
   - Clean tools with alcohol
   - Clean glass
   - Clean hands

2. **Don't rush:**
   - Don't transplant until roots < 0.8 inch (2 cm)
   - Short roots = high death risk

3. **Less light:**
   - Clones don't need much light
   - Low light = focus on roots

4. **Don't touch:**
   - Don't move, don't pull out to check
   - Every movement = stress

5. **Use hormones:**
   - $15-25 for Clonex
   - Will increase success by 20-30%

## Growie's Tip

Water cloning is the perfect start for beginners! No need to spend money, no complex equipment needed. Just a glass, water, patience. Yes, it's slower than other methods, but you'll see the whole process with your own eyes: how white dots appear on the cut, how roots grow. It's magic! Start with 2-3 cuttings at once (increases success chances). And remember: the most common mistake is non-sterile tools. Spend 30 seconds cleaning with alcohol, save 3 weeks on a new attempt. In Growie, track your stats: how many clones rooted, how many days — this will help optimize the process!
