# Mother Plant: Care and Maintenance

![Mother Plant](/images/guides/mother-plant.jpg)

A Mother Plant is a plant you keep in constant vegetation to take clones from. Found perfect genetics → make it a mother plant → endless supply of clones with known characteristics. Invest once, use for years!

## What is a Mother Plant?

**Definition:**
- Female plant in permanent vegetation (18-24 hours light)
- Never flowers
- Used only for cloning
- Lifespan: 6 months - 2 years (and more)

**Why needed:**
- Preserve perfect genetics (taste, potency, yield)
- Don't buy seeds every time
- All clones identical (same height, same flowering time)
- Save money (seeds $5-15 each, clones — free)

## Choosing Mother Plant

### What Makes Genetics "Perfect"?

**Look for plant with:**

✅ **High yield:**
- Many side branches
- Fast growth
- Dense buds

✅ **Resilience:**
- Doesn't get sick
- Handles stress (heat, cold, mistakes)
- Mold/pest resistance

✅ **Good clones:**
- Cuttings root quickly (7-14 days)
- High success rate (80%+)

✅ **Taste and effect:**
- You like it!
- Good terpene profile
- Desired potency

✅ **Structure:**
- Compact (for SCROG/SOG)
- Or: tall with long branches (depends on preference)

### Where to Get Mother Plant?

**Option 1: From Seeds (best)**

1. Buy feminized seeds (5-10)
2. Grow to harvest
3. Choose best by characteristics (yield, taste, effect)
4. Revegetate this plant (return to veg)
5. Now you have mother plant!

**Pros:**
- Proven genetics (you know what you'll get)
- Clean plant (no pests/diseases)

**Cons:**
- Long (3-5 months from seed to ready mother)

---

**Option 2: From Clone (faster)**

1. Take clone from friend/dispensary
2. Grow to vegetation (4-6 weeks)
3. Keep in veg as mother

**Pros:**
- Fast (6-8 weeks)
- Known genetics (if clone from proven mother)

**Cons:**
- Pest/disease risk (check clone!)
- Unknown genetics (if from unproven source)

---

**Option 3: From Autoflower**

❌ **DOESN'T WORK!**

Autoflowers can't be kept in permanent veg (they flower by age, not light).

## Maintenance Conditions

### Light Schedule

**18/6 or 24/0:**
- 18/6: 18 hours light, 6 hours dark (recommended)
- 24/0: 24 hours light (grows faster, but more electricity)

**Recommendation: 18/6**
- Plant rests in darkness
- Save electricity
- Less stress

**Lighting:**
- CFL 40-100W (for small mother 12-20 inches / 30-50 cm)
- LED 100-200W (for large 24-40 inches / 60-100 cm)
- T5 fluorescent (great option)

**Intensity:**
- 200-400 PPFD (don't need bright light!)
- Mother doesn't need powerful light (only branch growth)

---

### Pot and Medium

**Pot size:**
- Small mother (12-20 in / 30-50 cm): 2-4 gal (7-15 L)
- Large mother (24-40 in / 60-100 cm): 4-8 gal (15-30 L)

**Medium:**
- Light soil (50% perlite + 50% quality soil)
- Or: coco + perlite 70/30
- Good aeration = healthy roots

**Drainage:**
- Must have drainage holes
- Tray under pot

---

### Temperature and Humidity

**Temperature:**
- Day: 72-79°F (22-26°C)
- Night (if 18/6): 64-72°F (18-22°C)

**Humidity:**
- 50-70% (optimal 60%)

**Ventilation:**
- Light breeze (strengthens stem)
- Fresh air (exchange every 1-2 minutes)

## Feeding and Watering

### Watering

**Frequency:**
- When top 1-2 inches (3-5 cm) of soil dry
- Usually once every 2-4 days

**Volume:**
- Until runoff appears (10-20% of volume)
- Don't overwater!

**pH:**
- Soil: 6.0-7.0 (optimal 6.5)
- Hydro/coco: 5.5-6.5 (optimal 6.0)

---

### Feeding

**Dosage:**
- 50-75% of recommended dose
- Mother in constant veg = salt buildup
- Better less than overfeed!

**NPK:**
- Vegetative nutrients (more N)
- Example: 3-1-2 or 5-2-3

**Schedule:**
- Feed: every watering (50% dose)
- Or: every other (100% dose)

**Flush:**
- Once a month flush with clean water
- Removes accumulated salts

---

### Micronutrients

**Important for mother:**
- CalMag (calcium + magnesium): once every 1-2 weeks
- Iron (Fe): if leaves yellow between veins
- Zinc (Zn): for new branch growth

## Pruning and Training

### Initial Shape (first 4-6 weeks)

**Goal:** Create bush with many side branches

**Method:**

1. **Topping:**
   - Wait for 4-6 nodes
   - Cut top
   - Get 2 main stems instead of 1

2. **LST (Low Stress Training):**
   - Bend branches horizontally
   - Expose lower nodes to light
   - More branches = more clones!

3. **Defoliation (optional):**
   - Remove large fan leaves (if blocking lower branches)
   - Don't overdo! Leaves = energy

---

### Regular Pruning (every 2-4 weeks)

**When to take cuttings:**

✅ **Best branches for clones:**
- Lower/middle branches (pencil thickness)
- Healthy, green, no damage
- Length 4-6 inches (10-15 cm)

**How many to cut:**
- Safe: 4-8 cuttings at once
- Aggressive: 10-20 cuttings (plant will slow for 1-2 weeks)

**Frequency:**
- Once every 2-3 weeks (let plant recover)

**After pruning:**
- Feed plant (help recovery)
- New branches grow in 2-3 weeks

---

### Mother Refresh (every 6-12 months)

**Why needed:**
- Old mothers slow down
- Roots fill pot
- Clone quality decreases

**Method 1: Transplant + root pruning**

1. Remove plant from pot
2. Cut 30% of lower roots
3. Transplant to fresh soil
4. Trim 30% of top growth

**Method 2: Refresh through cloning**

1. Take 3-5 clones from mother
2. Grow them for 4-6 weeks
3. Best clone → new mother
4. Discard old mother or flower it

## Problems and Solutions

### Mother Stretches (tall, thin)

**Cause:**
- Not enough light
- Too far from lamp

**Solution:**
- Closer to lamp (6-12 in / 15-30 cm from CFL/T5)
- More light (add another lamp)
- LST: bend top

---

### Leaves Yellowing

**If lower leaves:**
- Normal (plant drops old ones)
- Or: nitrogen deficiency (add N)

**If all leaves:**
- Overfeed (flush soil)
- pH problem (check 6.0-7.0)

---

### Clones Root Poorly

**Cause:**
- Mother overfed (too much nitrogen)
- Mother sick/stressed

**Solution:**
- Flush mother with clean water
- Reduce feeding for 2 weeks
- Let mother recover before taking clones

---

### Pests on Mother

**Problem:**
- Pests transfer to clones!

**Solution:**
- Immediately treat (Neem oil, insecticides)
- Isolate mother from other plants
- DON'T take clones until pests eliminated!

---

### Mother Flowered (pistils appeared)

**Cause:**
- Light schedule disrupted (was less than 18 hours light)
- Or: stress

**Solution:**
- Return to 18/6 or 24/0
- Plant will revegetate in 2-4 weeks
- Don't take clones until fully revegetated!

## How Many Clones Can You Take?

### From One Mother (at once)

**Safe:**
- 4-8 cuttings
- Mother recovers in 1-2 weeks

**Aggressive:**
- 10-20 cuttings
- Mother recovers in 2-4 weeks

**Maximum:**
- 30-50 cuttings (if urgently needed)
- Mother significantly slows (4-6 weeks)
- Not recommended to do often!

---

### Per Year (from one mother)

**Conservative approach:**
- 8 clones every 3 weeks
- = ~130 clones per year

**Aggressive approach:**
- 15 clones every 2 weeks
- = ~390 clones per year

**Extreme approach:**
- 30 clones every 3 weeks
- = ~520 clones per year

## Location and Space

### Where to Keep Mother?

**Option 1: Separate box/tent**
- Ideal (isolation from flowering plants)
- Size: 2×2 ft (60×60 cm) for 1-2 mothers
- Lighting: CFL/T5/LED 100-200W

**Option 2: With plants in vegetation**
- Save space
- Same light schedule (18/6)
- Mother next to clones/seedlings

**Option 3: Separate room (window light)**
- If south-facing window (lots of light)
- Save electricity
- But: less light control

---

### How Many Mothers to Keep?

**For personal use:**
- 1 mother (if need 5-10 clones per month)
- 2-3 mothers (if experimenting with genetics)

**For commercial:**
- 5-10 mothers (different genetics for clients)
- Rotation: refresh every 6-12 months

## Pros and Cons of Mother Plant

### Pros

✅ **Endless clones:** invest once, clone for years
✅ **Save money:** don't buy seeds ($5-15 each)
✅ **Known genetics:** know exactly what you'll get
✅ **Uniform plants:** all clones same growth/flowering (perfect for SCROG/SOG)

### Cons

❌ **Takes space:** need separate box/tent
❌ **Electricity:** lamp runs 18-24 hours
❌ **Care:** need to water, feed, prune
❌ **Risk of loss:** if mother dies/gets infected → lose genetics

## Alternatives to Mother

### 1. Buy Seeds Every Time

**When suitable:**
- Rarely grow (1-2 times per year)
- Like trying new genetics
- No space for mother

---

### 2. Clone Clones (without mother)

**Method:**
- Grow plant from seeds
- Take 2 clones
- 1 clone → flower
- 1 clone → keep in veg, take more clones from it

**Pros:**
- Don't need permanent mother

**Cons:**
- After 10-20 generations genetics may degrade
- Risk of losing genetics (if forget to take clone)

---

### 3. Revegetation

**Method:**
- Grow plant to flowering
- Harvest
- Return plant to veg (18/6)
- Take clones

**Pros:**
- Tested genetics (yield, taste) before cloning

**Cons:**
- Revegetation takes 3-6 weeks
- Plant stressed

## Growie's Tip

Mother plant is an investment that pays off after just 2-3 cycles! Once you find perfect genetics (potent, tasty, high-yielding) → make it a mother → forget about buying seeds. My personal experience: one mother gave me 200+ clones in a year. That's $1000-1500 saved on seeds! Keep mother in separate box (2×2 ft / 60×60 cm sufficient), under CFL/T5 lamps (cheap electricity). Refresh every 6-12 months through cloning (take clone, grow for 6 weeks, make new mother). In Growie, track stats: how many clones taken, when pruned, when fed — this helps optimize care. And remember: healthy mother = healthy clones. Better to take 5 clones from rested mother than 20 clones from exhausted one!
