# Rooting Hormones: Complete Guide to Selection and Use

![Cloning Hormones](/images/guides/cloning-hormones.jpg)

Rooting hormones are substances that stimulate root growth in cuttings. One cut = thousands of cells ready to become roots. Hormones "activate" these cells. Result: roots 3-5 days faster + success up 20-30%. Clonex Gel is the gold standard, but there are cheaper alternatives!

## What Are Rooting Hormones?

**Definition:**
- Synthetic or natural substances
- Stimulate cell division in cut zone
- Speed up root formation

**Main ingredient: IBA (Indole-3-butyric acid)**
- This is an auxin (plant hormone)
- Makes cells transform into roots
- Naturally present in plants (but in small doses)

**How it works:**
1. Apply hormone to cut
2. IBA penetrates tissues
3. Cells receive signal "grow roots!"
4. Roots appear 3-5 days faster

## Why Hormones Needed?

**Without hormones:**
- Clone roots in 10-14 days (water/soil)
- Success: 60-70%

**With hormones:**
- Clone roots in 7-10 days
- Success: 80-90%

**Difference:**
- +20-30% to success
- -3-5 days time
- Roots stronger, denser

**Are hormones required?**
- No! Plants can root without them
- But: with hormones easier, faster, more reliable
- Especially for beginners

## How to Use Hormones

### Gel (Clonex, Olivia's)

**Step by step:**

1. **Prepare cutting:**
   - Cut at 45° angle (sharp blade)
   - Immediately place in glass of water

2. **Apply gel:**
   - Remove cutting from water
   - Dip cut in gel 0.4-0.8 inch (1-2 cm)
   - Hold 2-3 seconds

3. **Place in medium:**
   - Right after gel → into soil/coco/Rapid Rooter
   - Don't let cut dry out!

4. **Don't touch:**
   - Gel sticks to cut, works 7-14 days

**Important:**
- DON'T dip cutting directly into jar!
- Squeeze some into lid (to keep jar clean)
- Use fresh portion each time

---

### Powder (Hormex, TakeRoot)

**Step by step:**

1. **Prepare cutting:**
   - Cut at 45° angle
   - Place in water

2. **Moisten cut:**
   - Remove from water
   - Shake excess water (cut should be moist, not wet!)

3. **Apply powder:**
   - Dip cut in powder (0.4-0.8 in / 1-2 cm)
   - Shake off excess (light tap)
   - Should leave thin layer

4. **Place in medium:**
   - Right into soil/coco
   - Don't let dry!

**Important:**
- If cut too wet → powder won't stick
- If too dry → powder falls off
- Perfect: moist but not dripping

---

### Liquid (Clonex Solution)

**For aerocloner:**

1. **Dilute:**
   - 0.17-0.33 oz per quart (5-10 ml per L) of water
   - pH 5.5-6.0

2. **Fill reservoir:**
   - Completely fill reservoir with solution

3. **Place cuttings:**
   - As usual in aerocloner
   - Misters spray solution with hormone

4. **Change solution:**
   - Every 3-5 days fresh solution

**For hydroponics:**
- Same (add to nutrient solution)

## Dosages

**Recommended IBA concentrations:**

| Cloning method | IBA (ppm) | Product |
|----------------|-----------|---------|
| Soil/coco | 3000 | Clonex Gel, Hormex #8 |
| Rapid Rooter | 3000 | Clonex Gel |
| Water | 1000-2000 | Clonex Gel (dip) |
| Aerocloner | 100-300 | Clonex Solution (dilute) |

**Can you overdose?**

⚠️ **Yes! Too much IBA = bad**

**Signs of overdose:**
- Roots grow but weak, thin
- Or: roots don't grow at all
- Cut turns black

**Safe zone:**
- 1000-3000 ppm for gel/powder
- 100-300 ppm for liquid (diluted)

## Hormones vs No Hormones

**Results comparison:**

| Parameter | No hormones | With hormones (Clonex) |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|
| Rooting time | 10-14 days | 7-10 days |
| Success (beginner) | 50-70% | 70-90% |
| Success (experienced) | 70-85% | 85-95% |
| Root count | 3-5 | 5-10 |
| Root quality | Medium | Strong, dense |

**When can skip hormones:**
- You have experience (70%+ success without hormones)
- Genetics root easily
- Conditions perfect (temperature, humidity)

**When need hormones:**
- You're beginner
- Genetics difficult (slow to root)
- Want maximum success

## DIY Rooting Hormones

**Can you make your own?**

✅ **Yes, but results worse than store-bought!**

### Option 1: Willow Water

**Willow contains salicylic acid (stimulates roots)**

**How to make:**
1. Collect young willow shoots (10-15 branches, 4-6 in / 10-15 cm)
2. Soak in water (1 quart / L) for 24-48 hours
3. Use this water for cloning

**Effectiveness:**
- Works but weak (10-15% lower than Clonex)
- Free!

---

### Option 2: Honey

**Honey contains enzymes, protects from bacteria**

**How to use:**
1. Dilute honey with water (1 tsp per 7 oz / 200 ml)
2. Dip cut in solution
3. Place in medium

**Effectiveness:**
- Works as antiseptic (prevents rot)
- But: doesn't stimulate roots (like IBA)
- Better than nothing, worse than Clonex

---

### Option 3: Aloe Vera

**Aloe contains auxins (growth hormones)**

**How to use:**
1. Take aloe leaf
2. Squeeze out gel
3. Dip cut in aloe gel
4. Place in medium

**Effectiveness:**
- Works weakly (20-30% lower than Clonex)
- Natural!

**DIY verdict:**
- DIY works but weakly
- If budget $0 → try willow water or honey
- If have $15 → buy Clonex (2x better results)

## Storage and Shelf Life

**Gel (Clonex):**
- Shelf life: 1-2 years
- Store: room temperature, dark place
- Close tightly (dries out)

**Powder (Hormex):**
- Shelf life: 3-5 years
- Store: dry cool place
- Lasts very long!

**Liquid (Clonex Solution):**
- Shelf life: 2-3 years
- Store: room temperature
- Diluted solution: 1-2 weeks (in fridge)

**Signs hormone went bad:**
- Gel: changed color (became dark)
- Powder: lumps, wet
- Liquid: cloudy, sediment

## Safety

**For humans:**
- IBA is mildly toxic
- But: wear gloves (irritates skin)
- Don't eat, don't inhale powder

**For plants:**
- Safe at correct dosage
- Overdose: roots may not grow

**Environment:**
- IBA biodegrades
- Not toxic to soil/water

## Common Questions

### Can You Use Hormones on Seeds?

❌ **No, not needed!**
- Seeds already contain hormones for germination
- IBA for cutting roots (not seeds)

### Need to Use Hormones with Aerocloner?

✅ **Yes, but liquid form (Clonex Solution)**
- Add to reservoir water
- 0.17-0.33 oz per quart (5-10 ml per L)

### Can You Dip Cutting in Gel Twice?

❌ **No! Once is enough**
- Second time = overdose
- Can harm

### Clonex vs Cheap Powder: Worth Paying Extra?

**Clonex:**
- Easier to use
- Higher success (5-10% more)
- More expensive ($15-25)

**Cheap powder (TakeRoot):**
- Save $10
- Slightly lower success
- Harder to use

**Verdict:**
- Beginner → get Clonex (maximum success)
- Experienced → can use powder (economy)

## Growie's Tip

Clonex Gel is $20 that pays for itself from first use! One jar lasts 100-200 clones. That's +20-30% to success, -3-5 days time. My personal experience: without hormones 65% success, with Clonex 85-90%. Huge difference! Store Clonex in dark cool place (shelf life 1-2 years). Main lifehack: don't dip cutting directly into jar! Squeeze some gel into lid, use from there. This keeps jar sterile (no bacteria). If budget limited: Olivia's Cloning Gel for $10 works almost as well. If cloning a lot (50+ per month): Hormex #8 powder is most economical ($8 for 300-500 clones). In Growie, track stats: success rate with hormones vs without. You'll see difference yourself!
