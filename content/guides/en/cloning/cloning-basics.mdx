# Cloning Basics: Why and How

![Cloning Basics](/images/guides/cloning-basics.jpg)

Cloning is creating a genetically identical copy of a plant. You cut a branch, root it, and get a new plant with the same genetics. Faster and more reliable than seeds!

## What is a Clone?

**Clone** — a cutting (small branch) taken from a mother plant and rooted.

**Genetics:**
- 100% identical to mother plant
- Same sex (if mother is female, clone is female)
- Same characteristics (growth, taste, effect, yield)

**Difference from seeds:**
- Seeds = new genetics (even from same parents)
- Clones = exact copy

## Why Clone?

### Advantages of Clones

✅ **100% female plants**
- No need to grow males (saves time/space)
- Guaranteed all will produce buds

✅ **Known genetics**
- You know exactly what you'll get (growth, yield, taste)
- Found perfect plant → clone it infinitely

✅ **Faster than seeds**
- Clone roots in 7-14 days
- Seeds germinate + 2 weeks seedling = longer

✅ **Cheaper than seeds**
- One mother plant = hundreds of clones
- Seeds are expensive ($5-15 each)

✅ **Uniform plants**
- All clones same height, same size
- Perfect for SCROG, SOG

### Disadvantages of Clones

❌ **Need mother plant**
- Takes up space
- Must maintain constantly

❌ **Disease risk**
- If mother is sick → all clones are sick
- Pests transfer with clones

❌ **No new genetics**
- Can't try new strains
- Genetics may degrade over time

❌ **Harder for beginners**
- Requires skills and equipment
- Seeds are simpler (plant and grow)

## When to Clone?

### Best Timing

**Vegetative stage:**
- Mother plant in vegetation
- Minimum 4-6 weeks of growth
- Healthy, strong plant

**Don't clone:**
❌ During flowering (clones root poorly)
❌ Sick plant (will transfer disease)
❌ Stressed plant (recently transplanted, HST)

### How Many Clones Can You Take?

**From one plant:**
- Safe: 4-6 cuttings
- Aggressive: 10-15 cuttings (plant will slow down)

**Frequency:**
- Once every 2-3 weeks (let plant recover)

## Main Cloning Methods

### 1. Water Cloning

**Method:** Cutting sits in water until roots grow

**Pros:**
- Simple
- Cheap ($0, only need water)

**Cons:**
- Slower (14-21 days)
- Weaker roots

**For:** Beginners

---

### 2. Soil/Coco Cloning

**Method:** Cutting in soil/coco, roots there

**Pros:**
- Faster (7-14 days)
- Strong roots

**Cons:**
- Need materials (soil, hormones)

**For:** Intermediate level

---

### 3. Aerocloner

**Method:** Cuttings hang in air, roots sprayed with water

**Pros:**
- Very fast (5-10 days)
- 90-100% success

**Cons:**
- Expensive ($50-200)

**For:** Pros, commercial growers

---

### 4. Rapid Rooter / Jiffy

**Method:** Cutting in special sponge (Rapid Rooter) or peat pellet (Jiffy)

**Pros:**
- Convenient
- Good results (80-90%)

**Cons:**
- Need to buy ($10-20 per pack)

**For:** All levels

## What Do You Need for Cloning?

### Essential

1. **Mother plant:**
   - Healthy, in vegetation
   - Minimum 4-6 weeks growth

2. **Sharp blade/scissors:**
   - Sterilized with alcohol!
   - Sharp (clean cut)

3. **Water:**
   - pH 5.5-6.0
   - Room temperature

4. **Containers:**
   - Cups, pots, or special clone box

### Optional (but recommended)

5. **Rooting hormones:**
   - Clonex Gel ($15-25)
   - Or powder (cheaper)

6. **Dome/humidity box:**
   - For high humidity
   - Can DIY from plastic bottle

7. **Heating mat:**
   - To maintain root zone temp 68-77°F (20-25°C)

8. **Low light:**
   - CFL 20-40W or LED 50-100W
   - Don't need bright light!

## Cloning Process (Brief)

### Step 1: Preparation
- Prepare tools (sterilize with alcohol)
- Prepare cups with water/soil

### Step 2: Cut Clone
- Choose healthy branch (4-6 inches / 10-15 cm)
- Cut at 45° angle with clean blade
- Immediately place in water

### Step 3: Treatment
- Dip cut in rooting hormone (Clonex)
- Place in medium or water

### Step 4: Environment
- Humidity: 80-95%
- Temperature: 68-77°F (20-25°C)
- Light: 18-24 hours (low intensity!)

### Step 5: Wait
- 7-14 days until roots
- Don't touch, don't move!

### Step 6: Transplant
- When roots are 0.8-2 inches (2-5 cm)
- Transplant to pot

## Success Rates

**Typical results:**

| Method | Beginner success | Expert success |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| Water | 40-60% | 60-80% |
| Soil/coco | 60-80% | 80-95% |
| Rapid Rooter | 70-90% | 85-95% |
| Aerocloner | 80-95% | 90-100% |

**Why not 100%:**
- Poor cutting technique
- Wrong conditions (humidity, temperature)
- Sick mother plant
- Infection on tools

## Common Questions

### Can You Clone Autoflowers?

⚠️ **Technically yes, but don't!**

**Problem:**
- Autoflower starts flowering by age (not light cycle)
- Clone is same age as mother
- Clone will flower in a week → mini-plant

**Conclusion:** Grow autoflowers only from seeds.

### How Many Times Can You Clone a Clone?

**Theoretically:** Infinitely

**Practically:**
- 10-20 generations no problem
- After that possible genetic degradation
- Solution: refresh mother plant from seeds every 1-2 years

### Can You Clone During Flowering?

⚠️ **Yes, but difficult!**

**Problems:**
- Slow rooting (21-30 days)
- Clone needs re-vegging (return to veg)
- Low success rate (30-50%)

**Conclusion:** Only if no choice (save genetics).

## Growie's Tip

Cloning is a must-have skill for serious growers! Found the perfect plant (potent, tasty, high-yielding) → make it a mother and clone infinitely. Start simple: cloning in Rapid Rooter with Clonex gel — that's 80% success even for beginners. In Growie, track your clone stats: how many taken, how many rooted, how many days — you'll find your optimal method. And remember: tool cleanliness = 50% of success, always sterilize blades with alcohol!
