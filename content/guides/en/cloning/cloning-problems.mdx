# Cloning Problems: Diagnosis and Solutions

![Cloning Problems](/images/guides/cloning-problems.jpg)

Cloning is a simple process, but mistakes happen. Clones don't root, yellow, wilt, rot — sound familiar? In this guide we'll cover 15+ most common problems with diagnosis, causes, and step-by-step solutions. Save your clones!

## Common Causes of Failure

**Top 5 mistakes:**

1. **Non-sterile tools** (30% of problems)
   - Bacteria/fungi on blade → infection → rot

2. **Wrong temperature** (25% of problems)
   - Too cold (< 64°F / 18°C) → slow rooting
   - Too warm (> 82°F / 28°C) → bacteria, rot

3. **Insufficient humidity** (20% of problems)
   - Clone loses water faster than it absorbs → wilts

4. **Bad cut** (15% of problems)
   - Dull blade → torn cut → slow rooting

5. **Sick mother plant** (10% of problems)
   - If mother is sick → clones are weak

## Problem 1: Clone Wilted (leaves drooping)

### Symptoms
- Leaves hang down
- Loss of firmness (leaves soft)
- Appears 2-4 hours after cutting

### Causes

**Main cause: water loss**
- Clone loses water through leaves faster than it absorbs through cut
- No roots → no water absorption

### Solutions

✅ **Increase humidity:**
- Goal: 80-95%
- Cover with dome/plastic bottle
- Spray leaves 2-3 times daily

✅ **Reduce light:**
- Bright light = more evaporation
- Move farther from lamp (12-20 in / 30-50 cm)

✅ **Trim leaves:**
- Cut fan leaves by 50%
- Less surface = less water loss

✅ **Check medium:**
- Soil/coco should be moist (not wet!)
- If dry — spray surface

**Recovery time:** 12-24 hours

---

## Problem 2: Leaves Yellowing

### Symptoms
- Leaves turn yellow (from edges or completely)
- Starts 3-7 days after cutting

### Diagnosis: which leaves are yellowing?

#### Option A: Lower leaves yellowing

**This is normal!**
- Clone drops old leaves
- Focuses on roots
- If upper leaves green → all OK

**Solution:** Do nothing. Remove yellow leaves (so they don't rot).

---

#### Option B: ALL leaves yellowing

**Causes:**

1. **Too bright light:**
   - Clone can't photosynthesize without roots
   - Bright light = stress

   **Solution:**
   - Reduce light (CFL 20-40W sufficient)
   - Distance: 12-20 inches (30-50 cm)

2. **Nitrogen deficiency:**
   - If yellowing from bottom to top
   - Clone used up N reserves

   **Solution:**
   - Spray leaves with weak nutrient solution (25% dose)
   - Only vegetative nutes!

3. **Infection in medium:**
   - Fungi/bacteria attack stem
   - Block nutrient absorption

   **Solution:**
   - Discard clone (if rotting)
   - Next time: sterilize tools

---

## Problem 3: Roots Don't Grow (10-14+ days)

### Symptoms
- 14+ days passed, no roots
- Clone looks alive but doesn't grow

### Causes and Solutions

**1. Water/soil temperature:**

❌ **Too cold (< 64°F / 18°C):**
- Roots grow slowly (21-30 days instead of 7-14)

✅ **Solution:**
- Use heating mat (maintain 68-75°F / 20-24°C)
- Or: place in warm location

❌ **Too warm (> 79°F / 26°C):**
- Bacteria multiply → rot

✅ **Solution:**
- Cool water/soil (move to cooler location)
- Add H2O2 (peroxide) to water

---

**2. Water pH:**

❌ **pH out of range (5.5-6.5):**
- Roots can't form

✅ **Solution:**
- Check with pH meter
- Correct to 5.5-6.0 (water) or 6.0-6.5 (soil)

---

**3. Bad cut:**

❌ **Dull blade:**
- Torn cut → slow rooting

✅ **Solution:**
- Next time: sharp blade
- Cut at 45° angle
- One quick motion

---

**4. No rooting hormones:**

❌ **Without hormones:**
- Rooting slower by 5-7 days

✅ **Solution:**
- Use Clonex Gel or powder
- Dip cut for 2-3 seconds

---

**5. Weak mother plant:**

❌ **Mother overfed:**
- High nitrogen → clones root poorly

✅ **Solution:**
- Flush mother with clean water
- Reduce feeding for 2 weeks
- Next time: take clones from rested mother

---

## Problem 4: Stem Rots (brown, soft)

### Symptoms
- Stem at cut brown/black
- Soft, slimy to touch
- Rot smell
- Appears after 3-7 days

### Causes

**Bacterial/fungal infection:**
- Non-sterile tools
- Dirty water/soil
- Water too warm (> 79°F / 26°C)

### Solution

❌ **This clone can't be saved!**
- Discard immediately (infection can spread)

✅ **Prevention for future clones:**

1. **Sterilize everything:**
   - Blade: wipe with alcohol before EVERY cut
   - Cups: wash with soap, rinse
   - Medium: use fresh

2. **Control temperature:**
   - Water: 64-72°F (18-22°C)
   - Soil: 68-75°F (20-24°C)

3. **Add H2O2 (peroxide) to water:**
   - 0.1 oz per quart (3 ml per L)
   - Kills bacteria

4. **Change water every 3-5 days**
   - Fresh water = fewer bacteria

---

## Problem 5: Mold on Soil Surface

### Symptoms
- White/gray coating on surface
- Fluffy texture
- Appears after 5-10 days

### Causes

**Too high humidity + poor ventilation:**
- Humidity > 95%
- Dome never opened

### Solution

✅ **Remove mold:**
- Carefully remove with spoon/tweezers
- DON'T mix into soil!

✅ **Ventilate dome:**
- Open for 10-15 minutes 2-3 times daily
- Or: make small holes in dome

✅ **Spray with peroxide:**
- 3% H2O2 dilute 1:10 with water
- Spray soil surface
- Kills mold spores

✅ **Lower humidity:**
- Goal: 80-90% (not 95%+)

---

## Problem 6: Leaves Curl Up (edges bend up)

### Symptoms
- Leaf edges curl up (like taco)
- Leaves become stiff

### Causes

**1. Too bright light:**
- Clone protects from excess light

**Solution:**
- Reduce light (20-40W sufficient)
- Increase distance to lamp (12-20 in / 30-50 cm)

---

**2. Too high temperature:**
- Air > 82°F (28°C)

**Solution:**
- Cool room (AC, fan)
- Move lamp farther

---

**3. Low humidity:**
- < 60%

**Solution:**
- Increase humidity (80-90%)
- Spray more often

---

## Problem 7: Clone Suddenly Died (was green, turned brown)

### Symptoms
- Clone looked healthy
- After 1-3 days completely wilted/blackened

### Causes

**1. Pump stopped (in aerocloner):**
- Roots dried in 2-3 hours

**Solution:**
- Check pump daily
- Keep backup pump

---

**2. Soil dried out:**
- Clone without roots can't absorb water

**Solution:**
- Check soil daily (should be moist)
- Spray surface as needed

---

**3. Dome removed too early:**
- Humidity dropped sharply → clone dried

**Solution:**
- Remove dome gradually (acclimation 3-5 days)
- Day 1-2: open for 1 hour
- Day 3-4: open for 2-3 hours
- Day 5: remove completely

---

## Problem 8: Roots Brown (not white)

### Symptoms
- Roots brown/tan instead of white
- Slimy to touch
- Weak root growth

### Causes

**Root rot (Pythium):**
- Water too warm (> 75°F / 24°C)
- Lack of oxygen in water
- Dirty system

### Solution

✅ **Cool water:**
- 64-72°F (18-22°C) ideal
- Use aquarium chiller (or freeze water bottles)

✅ **Add oxygen:**
- For water: aquarium air pump
- For aerocloner: check misters (working?)

✅ **Add H2O2:**
- 0.1-0.17 oz per quart (3-5 ml per L)
- Kills Pythium

✅ **Change water:**
- Completely drain old
- Fill fresh (pH 5.5-6.0)

✅ **Clean system:**
- Wash reservoir, misters
- Rinse with peroxide

## Problem 9: New Growth Deformed

### Symptoms
- New leaves twisted, mutated
- Wrong leaf shape

### Causes

**1. pH problem:**
- pH outside 5.5-6.5
- Blocks micronutrient absorption

**Solution:**
- Check and correct pH

---

**2. Micronutrient deficiency:**
- Calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn)

**Solution:**
- Spray leaves with CalMag solution (25% dose)

---

**3. Virus/genetics:**
- Mother plant sick
- Or: bad genetics

**Solution:**
- Discard clone
- Don't take clones from this mother (check it for diseases)

---

## Problem 10: Clone Rooted But Doesn't Grow

### Symptoms
- Roots present (0.8-2 in / 2-5 cm)
- But no new growth appears
- Clone "frozen"

### Causes

**1. Root shock after transplant:**
- Roots damaged during transplant

**Solution:**
- Wait 5-7 days (clone acclimating)
- Maintain high humidity (70-80%)

---

**2. Insufficient light:**
- Too weak lighting for growth

**Solution:**
- Increase light intensity (gradually!)
- Transition to 100-200W LED or CFL

---

**3. No feeding:**
- Clone used up nutrient reserves

**Solution:**
- Start light feeding (25% dose)
- Vegetative nutrients (more N)

---

## Problem 11: Water in Glass Turns Green (algae)

### Symptoms
- Water becomes green
- Slimy to touch
- Bad smell

### Causes

**Too much light on water:**
- Light + water = algae

### Solution

✅ **Wrap glass:**
- Aluminum foil
- Or: black paper
- Blocks light → no algae

✅ **Change water:**
- Drain green water
- Wash glass
- Fill fresh

✅ **Add H2O2:**
- 0.1 oz per quart (3 ml per L)
- Prevents algae

---

## Problem 12: Misters in Aerocloner Clogged

### Symptoms
- Some misters don't spray
- Weak pressure

### Causes

**Mineral deposits or debris:**
- Hard water
- Debris in reservoir

### Solution

✅ **Remove and clean misters:**
- Rinse under tap
- Use needle to clear holes
- Soak in vinegar (30 min) if minerals

✅ **Install filter on pump:**
- Prevents debris entry

✅ **Use RO water:**
- Fewer minerals = fewer deposits

---

## Problem 13: Clones Root Unevenly

### Symptoms
- Some clones with roots on day 7
- Others without roots on day 14

### Causes

**1. Different cutting thickness:**
- Thin cuttings root faster
- Thick slower

**Solution:**
- Take cuttings of same thickness (pencil-sized)

---

**2. Different temperature in different spots:**
- Reservoir edges colder than center

**Solution:**
- Use heating mat
- Maintains even temperature

---

**3. Not all misters working (aerocloner):**
- Clones near non-working misters slower

**Solution:**
- Check all misters
- Clean/replace broken ones

---

## When to Discard Clone?

**Signs clone can't be saved:**

❌ Stem rotting (brown, soft, smell)
❌ ALL leaves dead (brown, crispy)
❌ Roots brown and slimy (root rot)
❌ 21+ days passed, no roots, clone wilted

**In these cases:**
- Discard clone
- Don't waste time on resuscitation
- Take new cutting (learn from mistakes)

## Growie's Tip

80% of cloning problems = non-sterile tools + wrong temperature! Remember two rules: (1) ALWAYS wipe blade with alcohol before each cut, (2) maintain water/soil temperature 68-75°F (20-24°C, buy heating mat for $20-40, it's the best investment!). Everything else is details. If clone wilted — increase humidity. If yellowing — reduce light. If rotting — discard and next time be more sterile. In Growie, keep diary: what problems occurred, what helped solve them — after 3-4 cloning cycles you'll be a pro. And remember: even experienced growers lose 5-10% of clones. If you have 80%+ success — you're doing great!
