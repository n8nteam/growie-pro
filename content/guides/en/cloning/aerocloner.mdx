# Aerocloner: Professional Cloning

![Aerocloner](/images/guides/aerocloner.jpg)

Aerocloner is the fastest and most effective cloning method. Cuttings hang in air, roots are sprayed with pressurized water. Result: 90-100% success in 5-10 days. Perfect for commercial growers and those who clone regularly.

## What is an Aerocloner?

**How it works:**
- Cuttings secured in neoprene inserts (collars)
- Stems hang in air inside container
- Root zone sprayed with water from misters 24/7
- Roots grow in air = maximum aeration + growth

**Why it works better:**
- Roots get 100% oxygen (in soil 10-20%)
- Constant moisture (doesn't dry out)
- No overwatering risk
- Perfect water temperature

## Results

**Simplicity:** 6/10 (need initial setup)
**Speed:** 10/10 (5-10 days!)
**Success:** 10/10 (90-100% even for beginners)
**Cost:** 3/10 ($50-200 ready-made, $30-50 DIY)

## Types of Aerocloners

### 1. Ready-Made Models (Commercial)

**Popular:**
- **EZ-Clone** ($100-300): 16-128 sites, professional
- **TurboKlone** ($80-250): 24-96 sites, good price/quality balance
- **Clone King** ($50-150): 25-36 sites, budget option

**Pros:**
- Ready to use out of box

## How Aerocloner Works

### Main Components

**1. Container (reservoir):**
- Holds water (5-20 L)
- Light-proof (black/dark)
- With lid

**2. Lid:**
- With holes for neoprene inserts
- Distance between holes: 3-4 inches (7-10 cm)

**3. Neoprene inserts (collars):**
- Hold cutting vertically
- Size: 2 inches (5 cm) diameter (standard)
- Soft, don't pinch stem

**4. Pump:**
- Power: 100-200 GPH (400-800 L/h, depends on size)
- Silent
- Submersible (inside reservoir)

**5. Misters (sprayers):**
- Create fine mist
- Spray root zone 360°
- 1 mister per 4-8 cuttings

**6. Tubing:**
- Connects pump to misters
- Diameter: 0.4-0.6 inch (1-1.5 cm)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Assembly (for DIY)

**1.1 Prepare container:**
- Container 5-10 gal (20-40 L, for 10-20 clones)
- Wash with soap, rinse

**1.2 Make holes in lid:**
- Diameter: 2 inches (5 cm, for neoprene inserts)
- Distance between holes: 3-4 inches (7-10 cm)
- Use drill hole saw

**1.3 Install pump:**
- Pump on bottom of reservoir
- Tubing goes up

**1.4 Install misters:**
- Misters on tubes
- Point up (toward lid)
- 1 mister per 4-8 cuttings

**1.5 Test:**
- Fill water (2-4 inches / 5-10 cm from bottom)
- Turn on pump
- Check: all misters spraying?

---

### Step 2: Water Preparation

**pH:**
- 5.5-6.0 (optimal 5.8)

**Temperature:**
- 68-72°F (20-22°C, ideal for roots)
- Use aquarium heater if cold

**Additives (optional):**
- Clonex Solution (liquid version of Clonex): 0.17-0.33 oz per quart (5-10 ml per L)
- Or: H2O2 (peroxide) 0.1 oz per quart (3 ml per L, against bacteria)

**Water level:**
- 2-4 inches (5-10 cm) from bottom of reservoir
- Important: cuttings DON'T touch water!

---

### Step 3: Prepare Cuttings

**Selection:**
✅ Healthy branches (middle/lower)
✅ Thickness: pencil-sized
✅ Length: 4-6 inches (10-15 cm)

**Cut:**
1. At 45° angle (sharp blade!)
2. 0.2 inch (5 mm) below node
3. Immediately into water

**Process:**
1. Remove lower leaves (2-3 inches / 5-7 cm from bottom should be clean)
2. Trim top leaves by 50%
3. Dip cut in Clonex gel (optional)

---

### Step 4: Install Cuttings

**Placement:**
1. Insert cutting into neoprene collar
2. Stem goes through center
3. Collar holds cutting but doesn't pinch
4. Place collar in hole in lid

**Check:**
- Stem hangs in air (doesn't touch water!)
- Misters spray stem
- Cutting stands vertical

**How many clones:**
- Don't overload: leave 20-30% sites empty
- For air circulation

---

### Step 5: Start

**Turn on pump:**
- Works 24/7 (continuously)
- Misters create mist constantly

**Lighting:**
- Low! CFL 20-40W or LED 50-100W
- 18-24 hours light
- Distance: 12-20 inches (30-50 cm)

**Humidity:**
- Aerocloner creates 80-90% humidity itself
- Dome NOT needed!

**Temperature:**
- Air: 72-79°F (22-26°C)
- Water: 68-72°F (20-22°C)

---

### Step 6: Care (first 5-10 days)

**Daily:**

📅 **Check water:**
- Level: should be 2-4 inches (5-10 cm)
- Top up as it evaporates

📅 **Check misters:**
- All working?
- Not clogged?

📅 **Spray leaves:**
- 1-2 times daily (optional)
- Clean water pH 6.0

**Every 3-5 days:**

📅 **Change water:**
- Completely drain old
- Fill fresh (pH 5.5-6.0)
- Clean misters

**Don't:**
❌ Don't pull out to check roots (first 7 days)
❌ Don't turn off pump (works 24/7)

---

### Step 7: Signs of Success

**Day 3-5:**
- Leaves firm, not wilted
- Color green

**Day 5-7:**
- Small white dots on stem (roots beginning!)

**Day 7-10:**
- Roots 0.8-2 inches (2-5 cm), white, healthy
- Ready for transplant!

---

### Step 8: Transplant

**When:**
✅ Roots 0.8-2 inches (2-5 cm) long
✅ Minimum 3-5 roots
✅ Roots white, fluffy

**How:**
1. Carefully remove cutting from collar
   - Air roots are very fragile!
2. Place in pot with soil/coco
   - Make hole size of roots
3. Gently cover with medium
4. Water lightly (roots already wet)
5. Acclimation: first 3-5 days low light

## Conditions for Success

### Water

**pH:**
- 5.5-6.0 (check every 3-5 days)

**Temperature:**
- 64-72°F (18-22°C, ideal 68-70°F / 20-21°C)
- Above 75°F (24°C) = bacteria, algae
- Below 61°F (16°C) = slow rooting

**Quality:**
- Dechlorinated (let sit 24 hours)
- Or RO water
- Or distilled

**Additives:**
- Clonex Solution: 0.17-0.33 oz/qt (5-10 ml/L, recommended)
- H2O2 3%: 0.1-0.17 oz/qt (3-5 ml/L, against bacteria)

---

### Pump

**Operation:**
- 24/7 without breaks
- If you turn off → roots dry out → death

**Power:**
- Small aerocloner (10-20 clones): 100-160 GPH (400-600 L/h)
- Large (30-50 clones): 200-300 GPH (800-1200 L/h)

**Noise:**
- Use quiet pump (< 30 dB)

---

### Lighting

**Intensity:**
- Low light! 20-50W
- Bright light = stress, slow rooting

**Schedule:**
- 18/6 or 24/0
- 24/0 slightly faster

---

### Sterility

**Critically important!**

**Before each use:**
1. Wash container, lid, misters
2. Rinse with 3% peroxide (1:10)
3. Rinse with clean water

**Tools:**
- Wipe blade with alcohol before each cut

## Growie's Tip

Aerocloner is the holy grail of cloning! Yes, initial investment $50-200 (or $30-50 DIY), but if you clone regularly — pays for itself from first use. My personal record: 98% success in 7 days (49 out of 50 clones rooted). Secret: water temperature 68-70°F (20-21°C) + Clonex Solution + sterility. Build DIY version first — if you like it, buy commercial. Main thing: pump must run 24/7 WITHOUT stops. One stop for 2-3 hours = loss of all clones. Keep backup pump! In Growie, track stats: when roots appeared, how many days to transplant — you'll optimize process to 95-100% success. This is the method for those who clone seriously and regularly. You'll feel like a pro when you see 50 clones with roots in a week!
