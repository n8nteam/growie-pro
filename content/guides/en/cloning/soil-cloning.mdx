# Soil Cloning: The Golden Mean

![Soil Cloning](/images/guides/soil-cloning.jpg)

Soil cloning (or coco) is the best balance between speed, cost, and success. Faster than water (7-14 days), cheaper than aerocloner ($5-10), 60-80% success. Perfect for intermediate level!

## The Method

**How it works:**
1. Cut clone
2. Dip in rooting hormone
3. Plant in soil/coco
4. Maintain 80-90% humidity
5. After 7-14 days — roots!

**Simplicity:** 7/10 (bit harder than water)
**Speed:** 8/10 (2x faster than water)
**Success:** 8/10 (beginners 60-70%, experienced 80-95%)

## What You Need

### Essential

1. **Medium:**
   - Option 1: Light soil (50% perlite + 50% peat)
   - Option 2: Coco (pure or with perlite 70/30)
   - Option 3: Rapid Rooter / Jiffy (ready cubes)

2. **Cups:**
   - Volume: 7-17 oz (0.2-0.5 L)
   - With drainage holes
   - Transparent (to see roots through walls)

3. **Rooting hormone:**
   - **Gel:** Clonex Gel ($15-25, best)
   - **Powder:** Root Riot, Hormex ($5-15, cheaper)

4. **Sharp blade:**
   - Sterile! (alcohol required)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Medium

**Soil/coco:**
1. Mix medium (if needed)
2. Moisten with water pH 5.5-6.0
3. Don't flood! Should be moist, not wet
4. Fill cups

**Rapid Rooter/Jiffy:**
1. Soak in water pH 5.5-6.0
2. Let excess water drain
3. Ready!

---

### Step 2: Prepare Tools

1. **Clean blade:**
   - Wipe with alcohol
   - Let dry

2. **Prepare hormone:**
   - Gel: squeeze into clean lid
   - Powder: pour into lid

3. **Prepare dome:**
   - Wash
   - Wipe dry

---

### Step 3: Cut Clone

**Choose branch:**
✅ Lower/middle branches
✅ Thickness: pencil-sized
✅ Length: 4-6 inches (10-15 cm / 4-6 nodes)

**Cutting technique:**

1. **At 45° angle:**
   - Sharp blade (not scissors!)
   - Quick, one motion

2. **Between nodes:**
   - 0.2 inch (5 mm) below node

3. **Immediately into water:**
   - Prepare glass of water beforehand
   - Clone in water while preparing others

**Processing:**

4. **Remove lower leaves:**
   - Keep 2-3 top fan leaves
   - Remove all leaves on lower 2 inches (5 cm)

5. **Trim top leaves:**
   - Cut by 50% (optional)
   - Reduces moisture loss

---

### Step 4: Hormone Treatment

**Gel (Clonex):**
1. Remove clone from water
2. Dip cut in gel 0.4-0.8 inch (1-2 cm)
3. Hold 2-3 seconds
4. Immediately place in medium

**Powder:**
1. Remove clone from water
2. Shake excess water (but cut should be moist!)
3. Dip cut in powder
4. Shake off excess powder
5. Place in medium

⚠️ **Important:** Don't let cut dry between treatment and planting!

---

### Step 5: Planting

**In soil/coco:**
1. Make hole (pencil/stick)
2. Depth: 1-2 inches (3-5 cm)
3. Place clone
4. Gently press medium around stem
5. DON'T compact too hard!

**In Rapid Rooter:**
1. Sponge already has hole
2. Place clone
3. Lightly squeeze sponge around stem

**Check:**
- Clone stands straight
- Doesn't wobble
- Leaves don't touch soil

---

### Step 6: Create Microclimate

**Dome:**
1. Cover with dome/bottle
2. Leave small gap for ventilation (0.04-0.08 inch / 1-2 mm)

**Humidity:**
- Goal: 80-95%
- Spray inside dome 1-2 times daily

**Temperature:**
- Air: 72-79°F (22-26°C)
- Soil: 72-75°F (22-24°C, ideal with heating mat)

**Light:**
- CFL 20-40W or LED 50-100W
- 18-24 hours light
- Distance: 12-20 inches (30-50 cm)

---

### Step 7: Care (first 7-14 days)

**Daily:**

📅 **Ventilation:**
- Open dome for 5-10 minutes
- 1-2 times daily
- Prevents mold

📅 **Spraying:**
- Leaves: 1-2 times daily
- Inside dome: as needed
- Clean water pH 6.0

📅 **Check medium:**
- Should be moist (not wet!)
- If dry: spray surface
- Don't water heavily!

**Don't:**
❌ Don't pull out to check roots
❌ Don't move cups
❌ Don't water from top (only spray!)

---

### Step 8: Signs of Success

**Days 3-5:**
- Leaves firm (not wilted)
- Color green (not yellow)

**Days 7-10:**
- New growth (small leaves)
- This is a sign roots started growing!

**Days 10-14:**
- Roots visible through drainage holes
- Or through transparent cup walls

**Ready for transplant:**
✅ Roots 0.8-2 inches (2-5 cm)
✅ Clone actively growing
✅ Firm leaves

---

### Step 9: Transition to Normal Conditions

**Acclimation (3-5 days):**

**Day 1-2:**
- Open dome for 1 hour, 2 times daily
- Gradually lower humidity

**Day 3-4:**
- Open dome for 2-3 hours
- Or make more holes

**Day 5:**
- Remove dome completely
- Clone ready for normal conditions

**Then:**
- Transplant to larger pot (1-3 L)
- Start light feeding (25% of normal)

## Conditions for Success

### Humidity

**Inside dome:**
- 80-95% (ideal 85-90%)

**How to measure:**
- Hygrometer (digital, $5-10)
- Or: condensation on dome walls = good

**Too much moisture:**
- Drops falling from dome onto leaves = mold
- Solution: ventilate more

---

### Temperature

**Air:**
- 72-79°F (22-26°C, optimal 75°F / 24°C)

**Soil (roots):**
- 72-75°F (22-24°C)
- Heating mat = +20% success

**Below 64°F (18°C):**
- Slow rooting (21+ days)

**Above 82°F (28°C):**
- Risk of bacteria, mold

---

### Watering

**First 3-5 days:**
- Only spray leaves and dome
- DON'T water soil!

**Days 5-14:**
- Spray soil surface (if dry)
- Don't flood!

**Check:**
- Finger in soil 0.4-0.8 inch (1-2 cm)
- Should be moist (not wet!)

---

### Lighting

**Intensity:**
- Low light! 20-40W
- Distance: 12-20 inches (30-50 cm)

**Schedule:**
- 18/6 or 24/0
- 24/0 better (roots grow faster without darkness)

**Don't use:**
❌ Powerful LED (100W+)
❌ HPS/MH lamps
❌ Direct sunlight

## Success Rates

**Typical results:**

| Medium | Beginner | Intermediate | Experienced |
|--------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Light soil | 60-70% | 75-85% | 85-95% |
| Coco | 65-75% | 80-90% | 90-95% |
| Rapid Rooter | 70-80% | 85-90% | 90-95% |

**With heating mat:**
- +10-15% to success

## Problems and Solutions

### Leaves Wilted (drooping)

**Causes:**
- Insufficient humidity
- Too bright light
- Soil dried out

**Solution:**
- Increase humidity (spray more often)
- Reduce light
- Check soil (should be moist)

---

### Leaves Yellowing

**If lower leaves:**
- Normal! Clone drops old leaves
- Focuses on roots

**If all leaves:**
- Too bright light
- Or: infection in medium
- Solution: reduce light, check sterility

---

### Mold on Soil Surface

**Cause:**
- Too high humidity
- Insufficient ventilation

**Solution:**
- Ventilate dome more often (3-4 times daily)
- Remove mold (carefully!)
- Spray surface with 3% hydrogen peroxide (1:10 with water)

---

### Stem Rots at Base

**Cause:**
- Soil overwatering
- Bacterial infection

**Solution:**
- Discard clone (can't save)
- Next time: water less
- Sterilize tools

---

### No Roots After 14+ Days

**Causes:**
- Cold soil (< 64°F / 18°C)
- Lack of hormones
- Bad cut

**Solution:**
- Use heating mat
- Next time: more hormone
- Check cutting technique

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

✅ **Fast:** 7-14 days (2x faster than water)
✅ **Strong roots:** roots adapted to soil immediately
✅ **High success:** 70-90% even for beginners
✅ **Inexpensive:** $5-20 for everything
✅ **Scalable:** easy to clone 10-50 at once

### Cons

❌ **Can't see roots:** need to wait until they emerge
❌ **Mold risk:** if too humid
❌ **Need materials:** hormones, dome, medium
❌ **Bit harder:** than water (but better results!)

## Growie's Tip

Soil cloning is the gold standard for most growers! Faster than water, cheaper than aerocloner, consistent results. My personal choice: coco 70% + perlite 30% + Clonex gel + heating mat = 85-90% success even for beginners. Main secret: don't overwater! Soil should be moist like a wrung-out sponge, but not wet. Buy a heating mat ($20-40) — it's the best investment, speeds rooting by 3-5 days and increases success by 15-20%. In Growie, track your stats: which medium, how many days, success rate — you'll find your perfect formula. And remember: patience! Don't check roots every day, give clone 10-14 days to root peacefully. Trust the process!
