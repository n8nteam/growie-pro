# Growing Media Types: Complete Overview

![Growing Media Types](/images/guides/soil-types.jpg)

The growing medium is where your plant's roots live. Your choice of medium determines watering style, fertilizer type, and overall growing approach. Let's cover all the main options.

## Soil

The most traditional and forgiving medium. Best choice for your first grow.

### Pros

- Buffers pH — forgives mistakes
- Contains nutrients
- Supports beneficial microbiome
- Simple to use
- Compatible with organic fertilizers
- Best taste and aroma

### Cons

- Slower growth compared to hydro and coco
- May contain pests and pathogens
- Heavy — harder to move pots
- Harder to control EC

### Best For

- Beginners
- Organic approach
- Priority on taste and quality

## Coco Coir

Coconut husk fibers. An inert medium with excellent properties — the sweet spot between soil and hydroponics.

### Pros

- Fast growth (close to hydro)
- Excellent root aeration
- Reusable
- Lightweight and convenient
- Resistant to pathogens
- Eco-friendly and renewable

### Cons

- Inert — contains no nutrition, needs fertilizers from day one
- Requires CalMag supplementation
- Dries quickly — more frequent watering
- Needs rinsing before use (if not pre-buffered)

### Best For

- Intermediate growers
- Want fast growth with soil-like convenience
- Willing to monitor pH and EC

## Perlite

Expanded volcanic glass. Lightweight white granules.

### Properties

- Improves drainage and aeration
- Contains no nutrients
- Doesn't absorb water (holds it on surface)
- pH-neutral

### Uses

- **As an amendment** to soil or coco (20-30%)
- **100% perlite** — for hydroponic systems (drip)
- **For rooting** clones

## Vermiculite

A layered mineral that expands when heated.

### Properties

- Retains water and nutrients
- Improves cation exchange capacity
- Lightweight
- pH-neutral

### Uses

- **As an amendment** to soil (10-20%) — increases water retention
- **For germinating** seeds
- **Don't use 100%** — too water-retentive, roots will suffocate

## Rockwool

Melted basalt spun into fibers. Popular in commercial growing.

### Pros

- Sterile
- Excellent air-to-water ratio
- Precise nutrition control
- Reusable (with treatment)

### Cons

- Needs preparation (soak in pH 5.5 water)
- Not eco-friendly — doesn't decompose
- Irritates skin and lungs when handling
- For experienced growers only

### Best For

- Experienced growers
- Hydroponic systems
- Commercial operations

## Clay Pebbles (Hydroton)

Fired clay balls. The standard for DWC and drip systems.

### Pros

- Reusable (rinse and sterilize)
- Excellent drainage
- Doesn't break down
- Stable pH

### Cons

- Doesn't retain water
- Contains no nutrition
- Needs constant solution circulation
- Heavy

### Best For

- DWC, drip systems, ebb-and-flow
- As a drainage layer at the bottom of pots

## Comparison Table

| Parameter | Soil | Coco | Perlite | Rockwool | Clay Pebbles |
|-----------|------|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| pH buffering | High | Medium | None | None | None |
| Water retention | High | Medium | Low | High | Low |
| Aeration | Medium | High | High | High | High |
| Nutrients | Yes | No | No | No | No |
| Growth speed | Medium | Fast | Fast | Fast | Fast |
| Difficulty | Easy | Medium | Medium | Hard | Hard |
| Reusable | No | Yes | Yes | Partially | Yes |
| Weight | Heavy | Light | Light | Light | Heavy |
| Fertilizer type | Any | Mineral | Mineral | Mineral | Mineral |

## What Should You Choose?

### First Grow

**Soil** — pre-made mix (BioBizz Light-Mix or similar) + 20-30% perlite. The simplest start possible.

### Want Fast Growth

**Coco** + perlite (70/30) with mineral nutrients and CalMag.

### Hydroponics

**Clay pebbles** for DWC, **rockwool** for drip systems, **perlite** for ebb-and-flow.

### Organic Approach

**Living soil** (super soil) — soil with organic amendments and microorganisms.

## Practical Tips

1. **Beginners — soil**, always. It forgives mistakes
2. **Add perlite** to any medium for better aeration
3. **Coco is a great next step** after soil once you've learned the basics
4. **Don't skimp on medium** — cheap outdoor dirt may contain pathogens
5. **Sterilize** medium when reusing
