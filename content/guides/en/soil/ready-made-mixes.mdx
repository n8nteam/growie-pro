# Ready-Made Soil Mix Guide

![Ready-Made Mixes](/images/guides/ready-made-mixes.jpg)

Pre-made soil is the simplest way to start growing. No mixing needed — just pour into a pot and plant. But not all soils are equal. Let's review the most popular and proven options.

## What to Look For

### Key Characteristics

- **pH** — should be in the 5.8-6.5 range
- **EC** — initial salt concentration (higher = more nutrition)
- **Composition** — peat, perlite, vermiculite, worm castings
- **Structure** — looseness, drainage, aeration
- **Pre-loaded nutrients** — how many weeks they last

### What to Avoid

- Garden soil — pests, diseases, unknown pH
- Cheap universal potting mix — often acidic and dense
- Soil with "6-month fertilizer" — impossible to control nutrition

## BioBizz Light-Mix

One of the world's most popular growing soils. Light, with minimal pre-loaded nutrients.

### Composition

- Sphagnum peat
- Perlite
- Lime (for pH adjustment)

### Specifications

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| pH | 6.2 |
| EC | 1.2 mS/cm |
| Nutrition | 1-2 weeks |
| Volume | 20L, 50L |

### Pros
- Ideal for seedlings and clones
- Won't burn young roots
- Full control over nutrition
- Good aeration

### Cons
- Need to start feeding early (week 2)
- Runs out of nutrition quickly

### Recommendations
- **Best choice for beginners**
- Add 20-30% perlite for better drainage
- Start feeding from week 1-2

## BioBizz All-Mix

The "loaded" version of Light-Mix. Contains more nutrients.

### Composition

- Sphagnum peat
- Perlite
- Worm castings (vermicompost)

### Specifications

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| pH | 6.6 |
| EC | 2.4 mS/cm |
| Nutrition | 3-4 weeks |
| Volume | 20L, 50L |

### Pros
- No feeding needed for first 3-4 weeks
- Rich microbiome
- Good structure

### Cons
- Too "hot" for seedlings — can burn
- Not ideal for autoflowers in small pots
- Harder to control initial EC

### Recommendations
- Transplant into All-Mix after 2-3 weeks in Light-Mix
- Don't plant seeds directly — only established plants
- Ideal for photoperiod strains

## Plagron Light Mix

BioBizz Light-Mix alternative from a Dutch brand.

### Composition

- Peat
- Perlite

| EC | ~1.0 mS/cm |
| Nutrition | 1-2 weeks |
| Volume | 25L, 50L |

### Pros
- Good aeration from coco fiber
- Light and loose
- Low EC — full control

### Cons
- Need to feed early
- Less available in some regions

| Nutrition | 1 week |
| Volume | 25L, 50L |

### Pros
- Very light and airy

## Comparison Table

| Soil | pH | EC | Nutrition | Price | For Seedlings |
|------|----|----|-----------|-------|--------------|
| BioBizz Light-Mix | 6.2 | 1.2 | 1-2 wks | $$ | Yes |
| BioBizz All-Mix | 6.6 | 2.4 | 3-4 wks | $$ | No |
| Plagron Light Mix | 6.0 | 1.0 | 1-2 wks | $$ | Yes |
| Plagron Royal Mix | 6.5 | 1.8 | 6 wks | $$$ | No |
| Canna Terra Pro | 6.0 | 0.8 | 1 wk | $$$ | Yes |

## Two-Soil Strategy

The optimal approach — combine light and nutrient-rich soils:

1. **Start** (weeks 1-3) — Light-Mix or Canna Terra Pro
2. **Transplant** — into All-Mix or Royal Mix
3. **Continue** — supplement with fertilizers as needed

This protects seedlings from burn while providing nutrition during vegetation.

## Improving Pre-Made Soil

Even good soil can be improved:

- **Perlite +20-30%** — better drainage and aeration
- **Vermiculite +10%** — if more water retention is needed
- **Mycorrhizae** — at transplant, in the root zone
- **Diatomaceous earth** — pest protection
- **Worm castings +10-20%** — extra nutrition and microbiome

## Storing Soil

- Store in a dry place, sealed packaging
- Not in freezing temperatures — microbiome can die
- Check expiration date
- Loosen and moisten before use

## Practical Tips

1. **Light-Mix to start** — always safer
2. **Add perlite** — soil "from the bag" is usually too dense
3. **Don't buy cheap** universal potting soil — pH and structure are unpredictable
4. **Moisten soil** before planting — dry peat repels water
5. **Don't compact** — roots need air
