# Pot Types: Plastic, Fabric, Air-Pot, and More

![Pot Types](/images/guides/pot-types.jpg)

A pot isn't just a container for substrate. Its type affects root aeration, watering frequency, and plant health. Let's cover all the main options.

## Plastic Pots

The most common and accessible option.

### Pros

- Cheap
- Easy to find in any store
- Retain moisture longer
- Easy to remove plant for transplanting
- Wide range of sizes

### Cons

- Poor aeration (air only through drainage holes)
- Roots circle the walls (root circling)
- Easy to overwater — water sits longer
- Heat up in sunlight

### Recommendations

- Drainage holes are mandatory
- Round is better than square (roots don't pack into corners)
- Light colors — less heat absorption
- Use saucers to collect runoff

## Fabric Pots

Smart Pot, GeoPot, and others. Growing in popularity among experienced growers.

### Pros

- **Air pruning** — roots don't circle
- Excellent aeration from all sides
- Better drainage — harder to overwater
- Roots develop more branched structure
- Foldable for storage
- Substrate warms up more evenly

### Cons

- Dry out quickly — water more often
- Can't sit directly in a water tray (wicks up)
- Harder to transplant (no rigid shape)
- Walls develop salt deposits
- Wear out after 2-4 cycles

### What Is Air Pruning

When a root reaches the fabric pot wall, it contacts air and stops growing. Instead of circling, the root branches out inside the substrate, creating a powerful root system.

### Recommendations

- Best choice for most growers
- Place on a rack or elevated saucer
- Water more often in smaller amounts
- Can be washed between cycles

## Air-Pot

Plastic pots with cone-shaped holes across the entire surface.

### Pros

- Air pruning (like fabric pots)
- Rigid construction (easier to transplant)
- Reusable
- Excellent aeration
- Professional quality

### Cons

- Expensive
- Dry out fast (even faster than fabric)
- Take up more space (cones protrude)
- Not available everywhere

### Recommendations

- Great option for coco and perlite
- Ideal with frequent watering or drip systems
- Less suitable for living soil (dries too fast)

## Self-Watering Pots

Two-level pots with a water reservoir at the bottom.

### Pros

- Water less often
- Plant drinks what it needs
- Convenient when traveling
- Consistent moisture

### Cons

- Poor aeration in the lower substrate
- Risk of root rot
- Not suitable for coco or hydroponics
- Harder to monitor pH and EC of runoff
- Not suitable for seedlings

### Recommendations

- Good for soil during flowering stage
- Don't use in early stages
- Monitor water level — don't overfill
- Add 30%+ perlite for better aeration

## Hempy Bucket

A regular bucket with a hole 2-3 inches above the bottom, creating a reservoir.

### How It Works

1. Bottom 2-3 inches filled with perlite or clay pebbles
2. Drain hole is above this layer
3. Water accumulates in the bottom layer
4. Capillary action wicks water upward

### Pros

- Simple design, DIY-friendly
- Reservoir provides buffer between waterings
- Works well with coco and perlite

### Cons

- Need to set the hole height correctly
- Risk of standing water
- Not for soil

## Comparison Table

| Parameter | Plastic | Fabric | Air-Pot | Self-Watering |
|-----------|---------|--------|---------|--------------|
| Price | $ | $$ | $$$ | $$ |
| Aeration | Low | High | High | Low |
| Watering frequency | Less often | More often | More often | Rarely |
| Air pruning | No | Yes | Yes | No |
| Transplanting | Easy | Harder | Easy | Difficult |
| Reusable | Yes | 2-4 cycles | Yes | Yes |
| For beginners | Yes | Yes | Medium | No |

## Drainage Saucers

Regardless of pot type, you need a saucer:

- **Plastic plates** — cheap and simple
- **Racks/stands** — pot is elevated, roots don't sit in water
- **Drainage systems** — tubes direct water to a collection container

**Golden rule:** the plant should never sit in water. Remove runoff from the saucer.

## Pot Color

- **White/light** — reflects light and heat, roots overheat less
- **Black** — absorbs more heat, but standard for indoor
- In a grow tent, color matters less if temperature is controlled

## Practical Tips

1. **Fabric pots** — best choice for most growers
2. **Drainage holes** — mandatory in any pot
3. **Don't place pots** directly on the floor — use a stand
4. **Pot size** = plant size (rule: 1 gallon per month of veg)
5. **Don't skimp** on pots — they're a cheap component with big impact

## Growie Can Help

With the Growie app, you can:
- Find the right pot for your growing style
- Get watering schedules for specific pot types
- Log observations across different pots
