# Transplanting: When, How, and What Pot Size

![Transplanting](/images/guides/transplanting.jpg)

Transplanting is stressful for plants but necessary for healthy growth. Proper transplanting at the right time accelerates development, while mistakes can set growth back by days or even weeks.

## Why Transplant

- Roots have filled the current pot (root bound)
- Plant needs more space to grow
- Transitioning to more nutritious substrate
- Managing root mass size at different stages

## When to Transplant

### Signs It's Time

- **Roots visible** through drainage holes
- **Growth has slowed** despite proper care
- **Medium dries** within a day (faster than normal)
- **Plant wilts** between waterings
- **Leaves are smaller** and paler
- **Roots** wrap around the pot shape (when removed)

### Optimal Timing

| Stage | From Pot | To Pot | Notes |
|-------|---------|--------|-------|
| Seedling | Solo cup (8 oz) | 0.5 gallon | When 2-3 pairs of true leaves |
| Early veg | 0.5 gallon | 1-2 gallon | When plant outgrows pot |
| Final | 1-2 gallon | 3-5 gallon | 1-2 weeks before flipping to flower |

### When NOT to Transplant

- **During flowering** — severe stress, yield loss
- **At night** — transplant with lights on
- **When medium is dry** — root ball crumbles and damages roots
- **Autoflowers** — plant directly in the final pot

## Pot Sizes

### Volume Recommendations

| Plant Type | Final Pot | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Auto, small | 2-3 gallon | Don't transplant |
| Auto, large | 3-4 gallon | Don't transplant |
| Photo, SOG | 1-2 gallon | Many plants |
| Photo, standard | 3-4 gallon | Standard |
| Photo, large | 5-8 gallon | Long veg time |
| Living soil | 8-13 gallon | Microbiome needs volume |

### Escalation Rule

Increase pot size by 2-3x each time:
- Solo cup → 0.5 gal → 1-2 gal → 3-5 gal

Don't plant seedlings directly in huge pots — roots can't colonize the entire volume and the medium goes stale.

## Transplanting Technique

### Preparation

1. **Water the plant** 1-2 days before transplanting (not the same day)
2. **Prepare the new pot** — fill with substrate, make a hole
3. **Prepare mycorrhizae** (if using) — sprinkle in the hole
4. **Work with clean hands** or gloves

### Process

1. **Gently remove** the plant from the old pot:
   - Flip the pot, supporting the stem between your fingers
   - Tap the bottom and sides
   - Pull gently — don't yank
2. **Inspect the roots**:
   - White and healthy — excellent
   - Brown and mushy — watering issues
   - Wrapped around — gently loosen the bottom ones
3. **Place in new pot**:
   - Substrate level should be the same
   - Can bury stem 0.5-1 inch deeper (forms additional roots)
4. **Fill substrate** around the root ball
5. **Lightly press** — don't compact heavily
6. **Water** with a small amount
7. **Optional**: add root stimulant to the water

### After Transplanting

- Place in shade for 12-24 hours (no direct light)
- Don't fertilize for 3-5 days
- Don't water heavily for the first few days
- Slight wilting is normal — recovers within a day
- Resume normal schedule after 3-5 days

## Transplanting from Peat Pellets

If you germinated in a peat pellet:

1. Don't remove the mesh — roots grow through it
2. Place the pellet in the hole in the new pot
3. Cover with substrate
4. Water

## Minimizing Stress

### What Helps

- **Root stimulant** — Rhizotonic, Root-Juice
- **Mycorrhizae** — apply to roots during transplant
- **Vitamin B1** — reduces stress
- **Right timing** — not too early, not too late
- **Careful handling** — don't damage roots

### What to Avoid

- Transplanting in heat or high humidity
- Damaging the root ball
- Heavy watering right after — let roots "grab on"
- Fertilizers in the first few days

## Direct Planting (No Transplant)

For autoflowers and those wanting to avoid stress:

1. Plant seed or clone directly in the final pot
2. Water only in a small circle around the plant
3. Gradually expand the watering zone as it grows
4. Roots colonize the pot gradually

### Pros
- No transplant stress
- Easier for autoflowers

### Cons
- Slower root development at start
- Overwatering risk (big pot, small plant)
- Harder to control moisture

## Common Mistakes

1. **Transplanting during flowering** — 1-2 weeks of lost growth
2. **Too big of a jump** — from solo cup straight to 5 gallons
3. **Dry root ball** — crumbles and injures roots
4. **Soaking wet root ball** — too heavy, falls apart
5. **Burying above cotyledons** — stem can rot
6. **Fertilizing immediately** — stressed roots won't absorb

## Practical Tips

1. **Water the day before** transplanting — root ball holds shape
2. **Mycorrhizae at every transplant** — directly on roots
3. **Shade for 12-24 hours** after transplanting
4. **Autoflowers — straight into final** pot
5. **Photoperiod — 2-3 transplants** per cycle
6. **Don't rush fertilizers** after transplanting
