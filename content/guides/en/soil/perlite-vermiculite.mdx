# Perlite, Vermiculite, Clay Pebbles, and Other Amendments

![Substrate Amendments](/images/guides/perlite-vermiculite.jpg)

Substrate amendments are components that improve the physical properties of your growing medium: drainage, aeration, water retention, or structure. The right amendments can significantly improve root conditions.

## Perlite

The most popular and versatile amendment. Expanded volcanic glass, white in color.

### Properties

- Very lightweight (floats in water)
- Doesn't absorb water — holds it on the surface
- Creates air pockets in the substrate
- pH-neutral (6.5-7.5)
- Chemically inert
- Doesn't decompose

### Grades

| Grade | Size | Use |
|-------|------|-----|
| Fine | 1-3 mm | Seedlings, seeds |
| Medium | 3-5 mm | Universal |
| Coarse | 5-10 mm | Drainage layer, hydroponics |

### How Much to Add

- **To soil**: 20-30% by volume
- **To coco**: 20-40% by volume
- **100% perlite**: hydroponic systems, rooting clones

### Tips

- Moisten perlite before mixing — it's very dusty
- Wear a dust mask when handling dry perlite
- It floats to the surface over time — normal
- Replace when reusing substrate

## Vermiculite

A layered mineral (mica) expanded by heat. Golden flakes.

### Properties

- Absorbs and retains water (up to 500% its weight)
- Retains nutrients (high CEC)
- Lightweight
- pH-neutral (6.5-7.2)
- Contains small amounts of magnesium and potassium

### How Much to Add

- **To soil**: 10-15% to increase water retention
- **For seedlings**: 15-20% — retains moisture for delicate roots
- **For germination**: can use 100% — seeds love moisture
- **Don't exceed 20%** in main substrate — too wet

### Perlite vs Vermiculite

| Parameter | Perlite | Vermiculite |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| Main function | Drainage, aeration | Water retention |
| Absorbs water | No | Yes (a lot) |
| Retains nutrients | No | Yes |
| When to add | Need drainage | Need moisture |
| Can use 100% | Yes (hydro) | No (rot risk) |

**They complement each other**, not replace. You can use both.

## Clay Pebbles (Hydroton)

Fired clay in round, porous balls.

### Properties

- Heavier than perlite
- Doesn't absorb water (minimal)
- Excellent drainage
- Reusable — rinse and sterilize
- pH-neutral after rinsing

### Uses

- **Drainage layer** at pot bottom (1 inch)
- **100% clay pebbles** for DWC and ebb-and-flow
- **Mulch** — top layer to prevent gnats and evaporation

### Preparation

1. Rinse off dust and debris
2. Soak in pH 5.5 water for 24 hours (for new pebbles)
3. Sterilize when reusing (hydrogen peroxide or boiling)

## Diatomaceous Earth

Sedimentary rock made from fossilized diatom algae.

### Properties

- Contains 80-90% silicon
- Abrasive to insects
- Absorbs moisture

### Uses

- **Pest protection** — damages exoskeletons of gnats, thrips
- Sprinkle on substrate surface (1-2mm layer)
- Mix 5-10% into substrate as silicon source
- Only works dry — loses effectiveness after watering

## Biochar

Wood charred at high temperature without oxygen.

### Properties

- Enormous porous surface area
- Adsorbs toxins and heavy metals
- Habitat for beneficial bacteria
- Stabilizes pH
- Doesn't decompose for centuries

### Uses

- Add 5-10% to substrate
- Crush to 3-10mm pieces
- Pre-soak in compost tea solution (colonizes with bacteria)
- Works great in living soil (super soil)

## Horticultural vs Construction Perlite

Important distinction:

| Parameter | Horticultural | Construction |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Grade | 1-5 mm | 0.5-2 mm |
| Treatment | Clean | May contain additives |
| Price | Higher | Lower |
| For plants | Yes | Not recommended |

Only use horticultural perlite — construction grade may contain chemical additives.

## Recommended Combinations

### For Soil

- Soil 65% + perlite 25% + vermiculite 10%
- Ideal for most situations

### For Coco

- Coco 70% + perlite 30%
- The gold standard

### For Seedlings

- Peat 50% + perlite 30% + vermiculite 20%
- Light and moisture-retentive

### For Living Soil

- Soil 40% + compost 20% + perlite 20% + biochar 10% + vermiculite 10%
- Rich and well-structured

## Practical Tips

1. **Perlite is a mandatory amendment** for any substrate
2. **Be careful with vermiculite** quantity — easy to overwater
3. **Clay pebbles at the bottom** — simple way to improve drainage
4. **Don't substitute styrofoam for perlite** — it doesn't work the same
5. **Wet perlite** doesn't dust — moisten before mixing
