# Living Soil and Super Soil

![Living Soil](/images/guides/living-soil.jpg)

Living soil is a self-sustaining ecosystem where the plant gets everything it needs from microorganisms. Properly prepared living soil requires no liquid fertilizers — just water.

## What Is Living Soil

Living soil isn't just dirt with fertilizers. It's a complete ecosystem:

- **Bacteria** break down organic matter into absorbable forms
- **Fungi** (mycorrhizae) extend the root feeding zone by hundreds of times
- **Protozoa** and nematodes regulate bacterial populations
- **Worms** process organic matter and aerate the soil

The plant "communicates" with microorganisms through root exudates, requesting specific nutrients.

## Super Soil

Super soil is a specific living soil recipe popularized by Subcool. The idea: load all nutrients into the soil in advance so you only need to feed with water.

### Classic Subcool's Super Soil Recipe

**Base (large batch):**

| Component | Amount | Role |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Quality potting soil | 4-6 large bags | Base |
| Worm castings | 25-50 L | Nutrition + microbiome |
| Perlite | 25-50 L | Aeration |

**Organic amendments:**

| Component | Amount | Elements |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Bone meal | 5 lbs | Phosphorus, calcium |
| Blood meal | 2.5 lbs | Nitrogen |
| Bat guano | 2.5 lbs | Phosphorus |
| Dolomite lime | 2 lbs | Calcium, magnesium, pH |
| Epsom salt | 1 lb | Magnesium, sulfur |
| Azomite | 1 lb | Trace minerals |
| Humic acid | 0.5 lb | Improved uptake |

### Preparation

1. **Mix the base** — soil + worm castings + perlite
2. **Add dry amendments** and mix thoroughly
3. **Moisten** to "wrung-out sponge" consistency
4. **Fill into containers** or bags
5. **Compost for 4-8 weeks** — microbiome needs to process the amendments
6. Turn weekly, monitor moisture
7. **Ready** when it smells like forest floor

### How to Use

Layer strategy:

- **Top 1/3 of pot** — light soil (Light-Mix or basic blend)
- **Bottom 2/3 of pot** — super soil

Roots grow down to the nutrient layer when ready. This protects young plants from burn.

## Simplified Living Soil Recipe

For those who don't want to source all super soil components:

### Components

| Component | Ratio | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Quality soil | 40% | BioBizz All-Mix or similar |
| Worm castings | 25% | Vermicompost |
| Compost | 15% | Mature, no odor |
| Perlite | 15% | Aeration |
| Biochar | 5% | Bacterial habitat |

### Amendments (per 13 gallons of substrate)

- Dolomite lime — 150 g
- Bone meal — 100 g
- Mycorrhizae — per instructions
- Trichoderma — per instructions

### Curing Time

Minimum 2-4 weeks. Longer is better (up to 8 weeks).

## The "Just Add Water" Method

Properly prepared living soil works on the "just add water" principle:

### Watering

- Only clean, dechlorinated water
- Let tap water sit 24 hours or use a filter
- pH adjustment **not needed** — microbiome buffers pH naturally
- Don't water to runoff — it washes out nutrition
- Water moderately, maintaining consistent moisture

### What Not to Do

- **Don't use mineral fertilizers** — kills the microbiome
- **Don't use hydrogen peroxide** — kills bacteria
- **Don't let it dry out** — microbiome dies
- **Don't overwater** — anaerobic conditions = rot

## Maintaining Living Soil

### Mulching

Cover the surface with mulch:
- Straw
- Hay
- Cover crops (clover)
- This retains moisture and feeds the top-layer microbiome

### Compost Tea

- Water with compost tea every 2 weeks
- Maintains and refreshes the microbiome
- Recipe in our compost tea article

### Top Dressing

If the plant shows deficiency:
- **Nitrogen** — nettle tea
- **Potassium** — banana peels, wood ash
- **Calcium/magnesium** — eggshell, dolomite
- **General nutrition** — top dress with worm castings

## No-Till Method

Advanced approach — don't transplant or disturb the soil between cycles:

1. Cut the stem after harvest (leave roots in soil)
2. Add a layer of compost or worm castings on top
3. Plant directly into this soil
4. Old roots become food for the microbiome
5. Soil improves with each cycle

### No-Till Benefits

- Ecosystem develops and strengthens
- Fungal network (mycelium) stays intact
- Less work
- Better taste with each cycle

## Pots for Living Soil

- **Minimum 5-8 gallons** — microbiome needs volume
- **Fabric pots** — best aeration
- **Large containers** (15-25 gallons) — for No-Till
- **Raised beds** — for growing multiple plants indoors

## Pros and Cons of Living Soil

### Pros

- Best taste and aroma
- Minimal work after preparation
- Eco-friendly
- No pH meter or EC meter needed
- Self-regenerating system
- No salt buildup issues

### Cons

- Long preparation (4-8 weeks)
- Harder to diagnose problems
- Less control
- Slower than hydro or coco
- Needs large pots
- Initial investment in components

## Practical Tips

1. **Don't rush** — let soil cure at least 4 weeks
2. **Worm castings are key** — don't skimp
3. **Mycorrhizae are mandatory** — apply directly to roots at planting
4. **Big pots** — minimum 5 gallons, 8+ is better
5. **No chlorine** — use dechlorinated or filtered water
6. **Mulch** — it matters more than you think
