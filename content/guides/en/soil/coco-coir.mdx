# Complete Guide to Coco Coir

![Coco Coir](/images/guides/coco-coir.jpg)

Coco coir is one of the best growing media available. It combines the simplicity of soil with the speed of hydroponics. But coco has its own quirks that are important to understand.

## What Is Coco Coir

Coco coir is processed coconut husk fiber. It's an inert, renewable, and eco-friendly material.

### Forms Available

| Form | Description | Use |
|------|-------------|-----|
| Bricks | Compressed coco, expands when soaked | Economical, needs prep |
| Loose | Ready to use | Convenient, more expensive |
| Slabs/Mats | Flat blocks in plastic wrap | Commercial growing |
| Coco chips | Large pieces | Aeration supplement |

### Grades

- **Coco peat** — fine grade, high water retention
- **Coco fiber** — medium grade, good aeration
- **Coco chips** — coarse grade, maximum drainage

The ideal substrate is a mix of all three grades, or coco peat + perlite.

## Preparing Coco

### Why Preparation Matters

Untreated coco contains:
- **Sodium (Na)** and **chlorine (Cl)** — toxic to plants
- **Potassium (K)** — in excess
- Low calcium and magnesium levels

### Rinsing

1. Soak the brick in warm water (1 brick ≈ 2-2.5 gallons of substrate)
2. Transfer to a container with drainage
3. Rinse with clean water — at least 3-4 volumes
4. Measure runoff EC — should be < 0.5 mS/cm
5. If EC is high — keep rinsing

### Buffering

Coco naturally holds onto calcium and magnesium while releasing potassium and sodium instead. Buffering fixes this.

1. Prepare CalMag solution: 5 ml/L (EC ~1.0)
2. Soak rinsed coco in this solution
3. Leave for 8-12 hours (overnight is ideal)
4. Drain the solution
5. Lightly rinse with clean water
6. Coco is ready

### Pre-Buffered Coco

Many manufacturers sell pre-rinsed and buffered coco:
- **Canna Coco Professional Plus**
- **Plagron Cocos Premium**
- **Gold Label Coco**

More expensive but saves time and guarantees quality.

## Watering in Coco

### Key Difference from Soil

Coco is not soil. Watering rules are different:

- **Water more often** — coco dries faster
- **Always with nutrients** — coco contains no nutrition
- **Runoff is mandatory** — 10-20% every watering
- **Never let it dry completely** — coco shrinks and damages roots

### Watering Frequency

| Stage | Frequency |
|-------|-----------|
| Seedling | Once every 2-3 days |
| Early veg | Once every 1-2 days |
| Late veg | 1-2 times per day |
| Flowering | 1-2 times per day |

### Indicators

- Pot feels light — time to water
- Top layer dry 0.5-1 inch deep — time to water
- During flowering with large plants — can water twice daily

### Watering Volume

- Water until 10-20% runoff
- Seedling: 2-4 oz
- Veg: 16 oz — 1 quart
- Flowering: 1-2 quarts (depending on pot size)

## Nutrients for Coco

### What to Use

- **Mineral only** — organics don't work well in coco
- **Coco-specific** — Canna Coco, GHE with CalMag
- **CalMag — mandatory** with every watering

### CalMag in Coco

This is not optional, it's a requirement:

- Add CalMag **first** to the solution
- Dosage: 1-2 ml/L (EC +0.3-0.4)
- Entire cycle — from start to flush
- Without CalMag — guaranteed calcium and magnesium deficiency

### Approximate EC Schedule

| Stage | Solution EC | pH |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Seedling | 0.4-0.6 | 5.8-6.0 |
| Early veg | 0.8-1.2 | 5.8-6.0 |
| Late veg | 1.2-1.6 | 5.8-6.2 |
| Early bloom | 1.4-1.8 | 5.8-6.2 |
| Peak bloom | 1.6-2.0 | 6.0-6.2 |
| Flush | 0.0-0.2 | 5.8-6.0 |

### Mixing Order

1. Water (room temperature)
2. CalMag
3. Micro (or Part A)
4. Grow/Bloom (or Part B)
5. Supplements (PK, stimulants)
6. pH adjuster

## Monitoring Runoff

In coco, runoff is the main health indicator:

### What to Measure

- **Runoff EC** — shows salt accumulation
- **Runoff pH** — shows root zone condition

### Targets

| Parameter | Normal | Problem |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Runoff EC | Solution EC + 0.3-0.5 | If > solution × 1.5 → flush |
| Runoff pH | 5.5-6.5 | If < 5.0 or > 6.5 → adjust |

### When to Flush

- Runoff EC exceeds solution EC by more than 1.5x
- Signs of salt buildup (tip burn)
- Every 2-3 weeks as preventive maintenance

## Coco + Perlite Ratios

| Ratio | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| 100% coco | Drip irrigation with frequent waterings |
| 70/30 (coco/perlite) | Universal standard |
| 60/40 (coco/perlite) | Maximum aeration |
| 50/50 (coco/perlite) | Very loose, DWC-like regime |

**70/30 is the gold standard** for most situations.

## Reusing Coco

Coco can be reused 2-3 times:

1. Remove old roots
2. Rinse with clean water until EC < 0.5
3. Re-buffer with CalMag
4. Add fresh perlite (old perlite breaks down)
5. Can add enzymes to break down root remnants

## Common Coco Mistakes

1. **Forgot CalMag** — Ca/Mg deficiency guaranteed
2. **Watering like soil** — coco dries faster, needs frequent watering
3. **Didn't rinse the coco** — sodium and chlorine kill roots
4. **Complete dry-out** — coco shrinks and tears roots
5. **Organic fertilizers** — don't work properly in coco
6. **Soil pH range** — coco needs pH 5.8-6.2, not 6.5

## Practical Tips

1. **Buffering is mandatory** — don't skip this step
2. **CalMag in every watering**
3. **10-20% runoff** — don't skip it
4. **Monitor runoff EC** weekly
5. **70/30 coco/perlite** — start here
6. **Don't cheap out on coco** — low-quality coco may be loaded with salts
