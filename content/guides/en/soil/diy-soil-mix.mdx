# How to Make Your Own Soil Mix

![DIY Soil Mix](/images/guides/diy-soil-mix.jpg)

Pre-made soils are convenient but not always available or suited to specific needs. Learning to mix your own substrate gives you full control over composition and saves money at scale.

## Core Components

### Peat Moss (Base)

- **Sphagnum peat** — acidic (pH 3.5-4.5), fibrous, retains water well
- **Sedge peat** — less acidic (pH 5.5-6.5), more nutritious, denser
- **Recommendation**: sphagnum peat as base + lime for pH correction

### Perlite (Drainage and Aeration)

- Lightweight white volcanic granules
- Doesn't absorb water, creates air pockets
- Optimal: 20-30% of total volume

### Vermiculite (Water Retention)

- Retains water and nutrients
- Use 5-15% of volume
- Doesn't replace perlite — complements it

### Worm Castings (Vermicompost)

- Worm-processed organic matter
- Source of nutrition and beneficial bacteria
- 10-25% of volume
- Don't overdo it — can be too "hot"

### Dolomite Lime

- Raises peat pH
- Source of calcium and magnesium
- 3-5 grams per liter of substrate

### Coco Fiber

- Alternative or supplement to peat
- Improves aeration and structure
- Rinse before use (if not pre-buffered)

## Recipe 1: Universal Beginner Mix

Similar to BioBizz Light-Mix. Suitable for seedlings and young plants.

### Proportions

| Component | Ratio | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Sphagnum peat | 60% | Base |
| Perlite | 25% | Drainage |
| Vermiculite | 10% | Water retention |
| Worm castings | 5% | Light nutrition |
| Dolomite lime | 3 g/L | pH correction |

### Preparation

1. Moisten the peat — dry peat is hard to mix
2. Add lime and mix well
3. Add perlite and vermiculite
4. Add worm castings
5. Mix thoroughly
6. Let sit 24-48 hours for pH to stabilize
7. Check pH — should be 6.0-6.5

## Recipe 2: Nutrient-Rich for Vegetation

Similar to BioBizz All-Mix. Contains 3-4 weeks of nutrition.

### Proportions

| Component | Ratio | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Sphagnum peat | 45% | Base |
| Perlite | 20% | Drainage |
| Worm castings | 20% | Primary nutrition |
| Compost | 10% | Additional nutrition |
| Vermiculite | 5% | Water retention |
| Dolomite lime | 4 g/L | pH correction |

### Preparation

1. Mix peat with lime, moisten
2. Add worm castings and compost
3. Add perlite and vermiculite
4. Mix until uniform
5. Let sit 1-2 weeks (microbiome activates)
6. Stir and moisten periodically

**Warning:** Don't use for seedlings — too concentrated.

## Recipe 3: Coco + Perlite

For those wanting hydro-like speed with soil-like convenience.

### Proportions

| Component | Ratio | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Coco coir | 70% | Base |
| Perlite | 30% | Drainage and aeration |

### Preparing Coco

1. If coco is in brick form — soak in water
2. Rinse with clean water until EC < 0.5
3. Buffer with CalMag solution (5 ml/L) for 8-12 hours
4. Drain, rinse, ready

### Notes

- Inert — fertilizers from first watering
- CalMag mandatory with every watering
- Water more frequently than soil
- Solution pH 5.8-6.2

## Recipe 4: Autoflower Mix

Autoflowers are sensitive to overfeeding and don't like transplanting. Need a light substrate.

### Proportions

| Component | Ratio | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Sphagnum peat | 50% | Base |
| Perlite | 30% | Maximum aeration |
| Coco fiber | 10% | Structure |
| Worm castings | 10% | Light nutrition |
| Dolomite lime | 3 g/L | pH |

### Tips

- Plant directly in the final pot (3-4 gallons)
- Don't transplant — autos don't like stress
- Start feeding from week 2-3
- Use 50% of recommended fertilizer dose

## Recipe 5: Clone and Seedling Mix

Maximum-light and safe substrate.

### Proportions

| Component | Ratio |
|-----------|-------|
| Sphagnum peat | 50% |
| Perlite | 35% |
| Vermiculite | 15% |
| Dolomite lime | 3 g/L |

### Notes

- No nutrition — only feed after first true leaves appear
- Maximum aeration for delicate roots
- Vermiculite retains moisture

## Mixing Tips

### Tools

- Large container or wheelbarrow
- Measuring containers
- Gloves (peat dries skin)
- Dust mask (perlite is dusty)

### Process

1. **Moisten peat first** — dry peat is hydrophobic
2. **Add components one at a time** — easier to mix
3. **Mix from bottom up** — don't compact
4. **Check uniformity** — no clumps
5. **Let it rest** — minimum 24 hours, ideally a week

### Storing Homemade Substrate

- In sealed bags or containers
- In a cool, dark place
- Use within 1-2 months
- Air out periodically

## Sterilizing Components

If using compost or garden soil:

- **Oven**: 175-195°F / 80-90°C for 30 minutes (not higher — kills beneficial microbes)
- **Microwave**: 5 minutes on max power (small volumes)
- **Hydrogen peroxide**: 3% solution drench — gentle sterilization

Store-bought peat, perlite, and vermiculite are usually sterile and don't need treatment.

## Practical Tips

1. **Start with a simple recipe** — peat + perlite + lime
2. **Write down your ratios** — so you can repeat a successful mix
3. **Test pH** after mixing and again after a week
4. **Make extra** — useful for transplanting
5. **Don't skimp on perlite** — aeration is critical
