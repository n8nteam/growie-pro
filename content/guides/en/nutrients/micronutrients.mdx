# Micronutrients: Calcium, Magnesium, Iron, and More

![Micronutrients](/images/guides/micronutrients.jpg)

Beyond NPK, plants need micronutrients. They're required in smaller amounts, but without them, key biochemical processes can't occur. A deficiency of even one micronutrient can seriously affect plant health and yield.

## Secondary Macronutrients

These elements are needed in larger quantities than trace minerals but less than NPK.

### Calcium (Ca)

**Role:**
- Building material for cell walls
- Cell division and growth
- Transport of other elements
- Disease resistance

**Calcium Deficiency:**
- New leaves are deformed, curled
- Brown spots on young leaves
- Growing tips die off
- Blossom end rot on fruits

**Important:** Calcium is immobile. Symptoms appear on new leaves.

### Magnesium (Mg)

**Role:**
- Central atom in the chlorophyll molecule
- Enzyme activation
- Phosphorus uptake
- Protein synthesis

**Magnesium Deficiency:**
- Interveinal chlorosis on middle and lower leaves
- Veins stay green while tissue between them yellows
- Leaf tips curl upward
- Later — brown spots and necrosis

**Important:** Magnesium is mobile. Symptoms appear on older leaves.

### Sulfur (S)

**Role:**
- Amino acid and protein synthesis
- Formation of essential oils and terpenes
- Enhanced aroma and flavor

**Sulfur Deficiency:**
- New leaves are pale green or yellow
- Resembles nitrogen deficiency but starts at the top
- Stunted growth

## Trace Micronutrients

Required in very small amounts but critically important.

### Iron (Fe)

**Role:**
- Chlorophyll synthesis
- Electron transfer in photosynthesis
- Cellular respiration

**Iron Deficiency:**
- Bright interveinal chlorosis on new leaves
- Veins remain green, tissue turns completely yellow or white
- Often caused by high pH (>7gt;7.0)

### Manganese (Mn)

**Role:**
- Photosynthesis participation
- Enzyme activation
- Nitrogen metabolism

**Manganese Deficiency:**
- Interveinal chlorosis on young leaves
- Small brown spots
- Similar to iron deficiency but less vivid

### Zinc (Zn)

**Role:**
- Auxin synthesis (growth hormones)
- Stem elongation
- Leaf formation

**Zinc Deficiency:**
- Small, deformed leaves
- Interveinal chlorosis
- Shortened internodes
- Leaves grow in clusters

### Boron (B)

**Role:**
- Cell division
- Sugar transport
- Reproductive organ development

**Boron Deficiency:**
- Thick, brittle stems
- Deformed growing tips
- Hollow stems

### Copper (Cu)

**Role:**
- Photosynthesis
- Carbohydrate metabolism
- Cell wall strengthening

**Copper Deficiency:**
- Leaves wilt and curl
- Dark bluish tinge
- Rare occurrence

### Molybdenum (Mo)

**Role:**
- Nitrogen metabolism
- Nitrate conversion

**Molybdenum Deficiency:**
- Resembles nitrogen deficiency
- Leaf edges burn
- Occurs at low pH (<5lt;5.5)

## Micronutrient Mobility Chart

| Element | Mobility | Deficiency Symptoms |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| Calcium (Ca) | Immobile | New leaves |
| Magnesium (Mg) | Mobile | Older leaves |
| Sulfur (S) | Semi-mobile | New leaves |
| Iron (Fe) | Immobile | New leaves |
| Manganese (Mn) | Immobile | New leaves |
| Zinc (Zn) | Immobile | New leaves |
| Boron (B) | Immobile | Growing tips |
| Copper (Cu) | Immobile | New leaves |
| Molybdenum (Mo) | Mobile | Older leaves |

## CalMag — When and Why

CalMag (calcium-magnesium) is one of the most popular supplements. When you need it:

- **Coco coir** — coco binds calcium and magnesium, supplementation is mandatory
- **Filtered / RO water** — contains no minerals
- **LED lighting** — plants under LED consume more calcium
- **Fast growth** — during active vegetative phase

**Dosage:**
- Typically 1-2 ml/L
- Add CalMag first, before base nutrients
- Check EC after adding

## Chelated Forms

Micronutrients are better absorbed in chelated form (EDTA, DTPA, EDDHA). Chelates are organic molecules that "wrap" the metal ion and protect it from binding in the medium.

- **EDTA** — works at pH 4-6
- **DTPA** — works at pH 4-7
- **EDDHA** — works at pH 4-9 (best option for iron)

## Practical Tips

1. **Most micronutrient deficiencies** are caused by incorrect pH, not actual shortage
2. **Don't add micronutrients separately** if using complete fertilizer — it already contains them
3. **CalMag is mandatory** with coco and RO water
4. **Excess of one element** can lock out others — maintain balance
5. **When in doubt** — check and adjust pH first
