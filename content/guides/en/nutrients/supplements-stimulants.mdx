# Supplements and Stimulants

![Supplements and Stimulants](/images/guides/supplements.jpg)

Beyond base nutrients, there are many supplements and stimulants available. Some genuinely improve results, others are marketing hype. Let's figure out what's actually worth using.

## Supplement Categories

All supplements can be divided into several types:

1. **Root stimulants** — root system development
2. **Bloom boosters (PK)** — yield increase
3. **Enzymes** — root zone cleanup
4. **Amino acids** — stress resistance
5. **Humic and fulvic acids** — improved nutrient uptake
6. **B vitamins** — stress recovery
7. **Silicon** — structural reinforcement
8. **Mycorrhizae and Trichoderma** — biological protection

## Root Stimulants

### What They Are

Products containing auxins, vitamins, and nutrients to accelerate root growth.

### When to Use

- First 2-3 weeks of life
- After transplanting
- During stress recovery
- When rooting clones

### Popular Products

| Product | Brand | Base |
|---------|-------|------|
| Rhizotonic | Canna | Seaweed, vitamins |
| Root-Juice | BioBizz | Humates, seaweed |
| Voodoo Juice | Adv. Nutrients | Bacteria |
| RapidStart | GH | Phosphorus, vitamins |
| Roots Excelurator | House & Garden | Silver, sugars |

### Worth Using?

**Yes** — root stimulants genuinely work. A powerful root system = healthy plant and bigger yield. One of the few supplements that pays for itself.

## Bloom Boosters (PK)

### What They Are

Concentrated phosphorus and potassium supplements for the flowering stage. Increase bud size and density.

### When to Use

- Starting week 3-4 of flowering
- Typically 1-3 weeks of application
- Stop 2-3 weeks before harvest

### Popular Products

| Product | Brand | PK Ratio |
|---------|-------|----------|
| PK 13/14 | Canna | 13-14 |
| Big Bud | Adv. Nutrients | 0-15-35 |
| Shooting Powder | House & Garden | 0-39-25 |
| Green Sensation | Plagron | 0-9-10 |
| KoolBloom | GH | 0-10-10 |

### Important Rules

- **Don't start before** week 3 of flowering
- **Use maximum 50%** of recommended dose the first time
- **Watch EC** — PK boosters spike concentration sharply
- **Don't use the entire cycle** — only 1-3 weeks
- **PK overdose** is one of the most common mistakes

### Worth Using?

**Conditionally yes** — with proper application, they give noticeable gains. But overdosing is worse than not using one at all.

## Enzymes

### What They Are

Protein catalysts that break down dead roots, nutrient residues, and organic waste in the root zone.

### Why You Need Them

- Clean the root zone of dead cells
- Prevent rot and pathogens
- Release locked-up nutrients
- Improve oxygen exchange in the medium

### Popular Products

| Product | Brand |
|---------|-------|
| Cannazym | Canna |
| SensiZym | Adv. Nutrients |
| Hygrozyme | Sipco |
| Power Zyme | Hesi |

### Worth Using?

**Yes, especially when reusing medium** and with organics. Affordable and genuinely helps maintain root health.

## Humic and Fulvic Acids

### What They Are

Organic acids formed from the decomposition of plant matter. They improve nutrient uptake.

### Humic Acids

- Improve soil structure
- Increase cation exchange capacity (CEC)
- Bind and retain nutrients
- Stimulate microbial activity

### Fulvic Acids

- Small molecules — easily penetrate cells
- Chelate micronutrients (improve absorption)
- Act as nutrient transport
- Effective in foliar feeding

### Popular Products

- **Diamond Nectar** (GH) — fulvic acids
- **Top-Max** (BioBizz) — humic acids
- **Humic Acid** (various) — powder or liquid

### Worth Using?

**Yes** — one of the most useful and underrated supplements. Especially effective in organic growing.

## Amino Acids

### What They Are

Protein building blocks. As supplements, they help plants recover faster and grow stronger.

### Benefits

- Speed up stress recovery
- Improve nutrient absorption
- Stimulate chlorophyll synthesis
- Increase heat and cold tolerance

### Popular Products

- **Amino Treatment** (various brands)
- **B-52** (Adv. Nutrients) — vitamins + amino acids

### Worth Using?

**Situationally** — useful during stress (transplant, extreme temperatures). In ideal conditions — not essential.

## Silicon (Si)

### What It Is

Not considered an "essential" element, but significantly strengthens the plant.

### Benefits

- Thickens cell walls
- Increases pest resistance
- Strengthens stems (supports heavy buds)
- Improves heat tolerance
- Enhances nutrient uptake

### Popular Products

- **Silica Blast** (Botanicare)
- **Armor Si** (GH)
- **Rhino Skin** (Adv. Nutrients)

### Application Rules

- Add **first** to the solution (before CalMag and nutrients)
- Silicate **raises pH** — be ready to adjust
- Don't mix concentrate with other supplements

### Worth Using?

**Yes** — cheap and genuinely strengthens plants. One of the best supplements by cost-to-benefit ratio.

## Mycorrhizae and Trichoderma

### Mycorrhizae

Symbiotic fungi that colonize roots and increase absorption area by hundreds of times.

- Increases phosphorus and micronutrient uptake
- Improves drought resistance
- Protects against pathogenic fungi
- Apply at planting/transplanting directly to root zone

### Trichoderma

Beneficial fungus that protects roots from pathogens.

- Suppresses fusarium, pythium, and other pathogens
- Stimulates root growth
- Add to medium before planting
- Compatible with organic fertilizers

### Worth Using?

**Absolutely yes** — mycorrhizae and Trichoderma are among the most effective supplements. Cheap, works, zero overdose risk.

## Supplement Effectiveness Ranking

| Supplement | Effectiveness | Necessity | Risk |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|------|
| Mycorrhizae / Trichoderma | ★★★★★ | High | Zero |
| Root stimulant | ★★★★☆ | High | Low |
| Silicon | ★★★★☆ | Medium | Low |
| Enzymes | ★★★★☆ | Medium | Zero |
| Humic acids | ★★★★☆ | Medium | Low |
| PK booster | ★★★☆☆ | Medium | Medium |
| Amino acids | ★★★☆☆ | Low | Low |
| B vitamins | ★★☆☆☆ | Low | Low |

## Minimum Supplement Kit

If budget is limited, here's the priority list:

1. **CalMag** — mandatory with coco and RO water
2. **Mycorrhizae** — at planting
3. **Root stimulant** — first 2-3 weeks
4. **PK booster** — at peak bloom
5. Everything else — optional

## Practical Tips

1. **Base nutrients matter more** than any supplement
2. **Don't buy everything at once** — add one at a time and observe
3. **Marketing ≠ necessity** — most "miracle supplements" aren't needed
4. **Mycorrhizae + root stimulant** — best investment
5. **Log** what you use and the results
