# Organic vs Mineral Fertilizers

![Organic vs Mineral](/images/guides/organic-vs-mineral.jpg)

One of the first questions every grower faces — which fertilizers to use? Let's break down the two main approaches: organic and mineral (synthetic).

## Mineral (Synthetic) Fertilizers

Mineral fertilizers are chemically synthesized salts containing nutrients in ionic form that plants absorb directly.

### Pros

- **Precise control** — you know exactly how much NPK you're giving
- **Fast effect** — plants absorb instantly
- **Simplicity** — mix according to instructions and water
- **Predictability** — consistent results every time
- **Cost-effective** — usually cheaper than organic
- **Hydro compatible** — the only option for pure hydroponic systems

### Cons

- **Salt buildup** — salts accumulate in the medium
- **No microbiome** — doesn't support beneficial microorganisms
- **Burn risk** — easy to overfeed
- **Taste impact** — some note a chemical taste without flushing
- **Dependency** — plant "forgets" how to process nutrients naturally

### Popular Lines

- General Hydroponics Flora Series
- Advanced Nutrients pH Perfect
- Canna (Terra, Coco, Aqua)
- BioBizz Bio-Mineral (hybrid)

## Organic Fertilizers

Organic fertilizers are naturally sourced materials (compost, worm castings, bone meal, etc.) that are first processed by soil microorganisms before becoming available to plants.

### Pros

- **Living soil** — develops beneficial microflora
- **Hard to overfeed** — slow nutrient release
- **Taste and aroma** — many report a richer profile
- **Eco-friendly** — natural components
- **Improves medium** — better structure and water retention
- **pH buffering** — microbiome stabilizes pH

### Cons

- **Slow effect** — needs time for microbial processing
- **Less control** — hard to know exact NPK
- **Odor** — some organic fertilizers smell
- **Not for hydro** — clogs systems (except specialized products)
- **Insects** — can attract fungus gnats
- **More expensive** — quality organic costs more

### Popular Products

- BioBizz (Bio-Grow, Bio-Bloom, Top-Max)
- Plagron (Alga Grow, Alga Bloom)
- Worm castings (vermicompost)
- Bone meal, blood meal
- Potassium humates

## Comparison Table

| Parameter | Mineral | Organic |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Speed | Instant | 3-7 days |
| NPK control | Precise | Approximate |
| Overfeed risk | High | Low |
| Microbiome | Not supported | Develops |
| Harvest taste | Flush needed | Clean |
| Hydroponics | Yes | Limited |
| Price | Lower | Higher |
| Complexity | Simple | Moderate |
| Solution odor | None | Possible |

## Hybrid Approach

Many experienced growers combine both types:

1. **Organic base** — worm castings, compost in the medium
2. **Mineral supplements** — targeted deficiency corrections
3. **Organic stimulants** — humates, amino acids, mycorrhizae

### How to Combine Properly

- Use organics as the medium base
- Supplement with minerals as needed
- Don't mix concentrated mineral and organic solutions in the same container
- Monitor EC — organics also contribute salts

## What Should Beginners Choose?

**Mineral**, if:
- First grow
- Hydroponics
- Want simplicity and control
- Limited budget

**Organic**, if:
- Growing in soil
- Priority is taste and aroma
- Willing to learn microbiology
- Not afraid to experiment

## Impact on Flushing

- **Mineral** — flushing is essential (1-2 weeks of plain water before harvest)
- **Organic** — flushing is optional but can help with cleanliness

## Practical Tips

1. **Start with mineral** — easier to control on your first grow
2. **Don't mix brands** — product lines are designed to work together
3. **Follow the manufacturer's chart** — but start at 50% dose
4. **Organics in soil** — the best combination
5. **Flush** when using mineral fertilizers
