# Popular Nutrient Brand Overview

![Nutrient Brands](/images/guides/nutrient-brands.jpg)

Choosing the right nutrients is one of the most common questions for new growers. There are dozens of brands on the market, each promising the best results. Let's break down the most popular and proven product lines.

## General Hydroponics (GHE) — Flora Series

The world's most popular nutrient line. Three components that cover all plant needs.

### Pros
- Proven over decades of use
- Flexible — adjustable ratios
- Works with any medium and hydroponics
- Affordable price

### Cons
- Need to mix three components
- Doesn't auto-stabilize pH
- Basic — may need CalMag and supplements

### Sample Schedule

| Stage | Micro | Grow | Bloom | ml/L |
|-------|-------|------|-------|------|
| Seedling | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.5 | — |
| Early veg | 1.5 | 2 | 0.5 | — |
