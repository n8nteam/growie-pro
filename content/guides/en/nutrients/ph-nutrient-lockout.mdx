# pH and Nutrient Lockout

![pH and Lockout](/images/guides/ph-lockout.jpg)

pH is the single most important parameter in plant nutrition. Even if you add all the right fertilizers, the plant can't absorb them at the wrong pH. This is called nutrient lockout.

## What Is pH?

pH is an acidity/alkalinity scale from 0 to 14:

- **0-6.9** — acidic
- **7.0** — neutral
- **7.1-14** — alkaline

The scale is logarithmic: pH 5 is 10x more acidic than pH 6, and 100x more acidic than pH 7. That's why even small deviations matter.

## Optimal pH Ranges

| Medium | Optimal pH | Acceptable Range |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Soil | 6.0 - 6.5 | 5.8 - 6.8 |
| Coco | 5.8 - 6.2 | 5.5 - 6.5 |
| Hydroponics | 5.5 - 6.0 | 5.3 - 6.3 |
| DWC | 5.5 - 5.8 | 5.3 - 6.0 |

## Element Availability by pH

Each element is absorbed within its own pH range:

| Element | Optimal pH | Locks Out At |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Nitrogen (N) | 6.0 - 7.0 | pH < 5.0 |
| Phosphorus (P) | 6.0 - 7.0 | pH > 7.5 or < 5.0 |
| Potassium (K) | 5.5 - 7.5 | pH < 4.5 |
| Calcium (Ca) | 6.0 - 7.0 | pH < 5.5 |
| Magnesium (Mg) | 6.0 - 7.0 | pH < 5.5 |
| Iron (Fe) | 5.0 - 6.5 | pH > 7.0 |
| Manganese (Mn) | 5.0 - 6.5 | pH > 7.0 |
| Zinc (Zn) | 5.0 - 7.0 | pH > 7.5 |
| Boron (B) | 5.0 - 7.0 | pH > 7.5 |
| Copper (Cu) | 5.0 - 6.5 | pH > 7.0 |
| Molybdenum (Mo) | 6.5 - 8.0 | pH < 5.5 |

This is why the universal range of 5.8-6.5 is optimal — all elements are available within it.

## What Is Nutrient Lockout?

Lockout occurs when an element is present in the medium but the plant can't absorb it due to:

1. **Incorrect pH** — the main cause
2. **Excess of another element** — antagonism
3. **Salt buildup** — EC too high
4. **Cold root zone** — below 61°F / 16°C

### How to Recognize Lockout

- Symptoms resemble deficiency but nutrients are present
- Runoff EC is much higher than solution EC
- Runoff pH differs significantly from solution pH
- Multiple deficiencies appear simultaneously

## How to Measure pH

### Tools

| Tool | Accuracy | Price | Recommendation |
|------|----------|-------|---------------|
| pH drops | ± 0.5 | $ | Fine for starters |
| pH strips | ± 0.5 | $ | Inaccurate, not recommended |
| Digital pH meter | ± 0.1 | $$ | Best option |
| pH controller | ± 0.01 | $$$$ | For automation |

### Calibrating Your pH Meter

- Calibrate at two points: pH 4.0 and pH 7.0
- Calibrate at least once a month
- Store the electrode in KCl solution
- Replace the meter every 1-2 years

### What to Measure?

1. **Input solution pH** — what you're watering with
2. **Runoff pH** — what drains out the bottom
3. **The difference** — if large, the medium is shifting pH

## How to Adjust pH

### pH Down (Lower)

- **Phosphoric acid** — most common
- **Citric acid** — organic option (unstable)
- **Nitric acid** — for veg stage (adds N)
- Add drop by drop, stir, wait 5 minutes, measure

### pH Up (Raise)

- **Potassium hydroxide (KOH)** — most common
- **Potassium silicate** — adds silicon
- **Baking soda** — last resort (unstable)

### Adjustment Rules

1. Mix all nutrients first
2. Wait 5-10 minutes
3. Measure pH
4. Add adjuster drop by drop
5. Stir
6. Wait 5 minutes
7. Measure again
8. Repeat until target reached

## pH Drift in Medium

Over time, medium pH changes:

- **Soil** — tends toward neutral (7.0)
- **Coco** — more stable but can drift upward
- **Hydro** — changes quickly, needs constant monitoring

### Causes of Drift

- Salt accumulation
- Organic matter decomposition
- Root exudates
- Water quality

### How to Combat It

- Water regularly at correct pH
- Ensure 10-20% runoff
- Periodically flush with correctly pH'd plain water
- Monitor runoff pH

## Medium Buffer Capacity

Buffer capacity is the medium's ability to resist pH changes.

| Medium | Buffer Capacity | Note |
|--------|----------------|------|
| Soil | High | Forgiving |
| Coco | Medium | Needs correction |
| Perlite | None | Fully depends on solution |
| Rockwool | None | Fully depends on solution |
| DWC | None | Needs constant monitoring |

## Flushing for Lockout

If you suspect lockout:

1. Prepare plain water at the correct pH
2. Flush the medium with 3x pot volume of water
3. Measure EC and pH of the last runoff
4. EC should drop to 0.3-0.5 mS/cm
5. After flushing — feed with light solution (50% dose)

## Practical Tips

1. **A pH meter is essential** grower equipment
2. **Always measure after** adding nutrients, not before
3. **Drift of ±0.3** is normal — don't over-correct
4. **Soil forgives** more mistakes than hydro
5. **Multiple deficiencies** = most likely a pH problem
6. **Change water** in hydro systems every 7-10 days

## Growie Can Help

With the Growie app, you can:
- Log pH for every watering and build charts
- Get notifications when pH is out of range
- Keep a flush journal
- Diagnose lockout from symptoms
