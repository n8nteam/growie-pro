# NPK Macronutrients: Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium

![NPK Macronutrients](/images/guides/npk-macronutrients.jpg)

NPK — the three essential elements without which plants cannot grow. The numbers on fertilizer packaging (e.g., 10-5-7) indicate the percentage of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Let's break down each element in detail.

## Nitrogen (N)

Nitrogen is the primary building block for plants. It's a key component of chlorophyll, amino acids, and proteins.

### Role of Nitrogen

- Drives vegetative growth and foliage
- Essential for photosynthesis
- Forms new shoots and leaves
- Critical during the vegetative stage

### Signs of Nitrogen Deficiency

- Lower leaves turn yellow and die off
- Plant appears pale green
- Growth slows down
- Stems are thin and weak

### Signs of Nitrogen Excess

- Leaves turn dark green and "claw" (curl downward)
- Delayed flowering
- Loose, airy buds
- Increased vulnerability to pests

## Phosphorus (P)

Phosphorus is the engine of energy processes. It's essential for energy transfer within cells (ATP).

### Role of Phosphorus

- Root system development
- Flower and fruit formation
- Cellular energy transfer
- Maturation and overall vitality

### Signs of Phosphorus Deficiency

- Leaves develop purple or purplish tones
- Dark green leaves with bronze hue
- Slow root growth
- Poor flowering

### Signs of Phosphorus Excess

- Locks out zinc, iron, and calcium
- Leaf tip burn
- Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins)

## Potassium (K)

Potassium is the master regulator. It controls water balance and nutrient transport.

### Role of Potassium

- Stomata regulation (gas exchange)
- Water and nutrient transport
- Immune system support
- Increases bud density and weight
- Sugar and starch synthesis

### Signs of Potassium Deficiency

- Leaf edges yellow and burn
- Leaves become dry and brittle
- Weak stems
- Poor bud quality

### Signs of Potassium Excess

- Locks out calcium and magnesium
- Salt buildup in medium
- Stunted growth

## Optimal NPK Ratios by Stage

| Stage | N | P | K | Notes |
|-------|---|---|---|-------|
| Seedling | 1 | 1 | 1 | Balanced nutrition |
| Early veg | 3 | 1 | 2 | Nitrogen emphasis |
| Late veg | 3 | 1 | 3 | More potassium |
| Transition | 1 | 3 | 2 | Sharp nitrogen drop |
| Flowering | 1 | 3 | 3 | Phosphorus + potassium |
| Peak bloom | 0 | 3 | 3 | PK booster |
| Ripening | 0 | 0 | 0 | Flush |

## Nitrogen Forms: Ammonium vs Nitrate

Nitrogen reaches plants in two forms:

- **Nitrate (NO₃⁻)** — absorbed quickly, raises pH
- **Ammonium (NH₄⁺)** — absorbed slower, lowers pH

Optimal ratio — 70% nitrate and 30% ammonium. Most quality fertilizers already contain the correct balance.

## Nutrient Mobility

This is important for diagnosis:

| Element | Mobility | Deficiency symptoms appear |
|---------|----------|--------------------------|
| Nitrogen (N) | Mobile | On lower (older) leaves |
| Phosphorus (P) | Mobile | On lower (older) leaves |
| Potassium (K) | Mobile | On lower and middle leaves |

All three macronutrients are mobile. This means the plant redirects them from old leaves to new growth when supply is low. That's why deficiency symptoms always show up on lower leaves first.

## Practical Tips

1. **Veg — more N**, flower — more P and K
2. **Don't overfeed** — start at 50% of recommended dose
3. **Watch pH** — without proper pH, nutrients can't be absorbed
4. **Flush** if you see signs of excess
5. **Log** your dosages in a journal (or in Growie)

## Growie Can Help

With the Growie app, you can:
- Track NPK fertilizer usage
- Get ratio recommendations for the current stage
- Keep a feeding diary with exact dosages
- Diagnose deficiencies from leaf photos
