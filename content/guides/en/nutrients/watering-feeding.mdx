# Watering and Feeding Schedule

![Watering and Feeding](/images/guides/watering.jpg)

Proper watering and feeding is the foundation of a healthy plant. In this guide, we'll cover when and how much to water, how to prepare nutrient solutions, and what to watch for.

## Watering Basics

### When to Water?

The simplest method — **the finger test**:
1. Stick your finger 1-2 inches into the medium
2. If dry — time to water
3. If moist — wait

### How Much to Water?

- Water until 10-20% runs out the bottom (runoff)
- This flushes accumulated salts
- Don't let the plant sit in standing water

### Wet-Dry Cycle

Plants benefit from alternation:
- **Wet**: after watering, roots absorb nutrients
- **Dry**: roots search for water and expand
- Don't water daily — let the medium dry out between waterings

## pH Control

Solution pH is critical for nutrient absorption.

| Medium | Optimal pH |
|--------|-----------|
| Soil | 6.0 - 6.5 |
| Coco | 5.5 - 6.5 |
| Hydro | 5.5 - 6.0 |

**How to measure:**
1. Prepare nutrient solution
2. Measure pH with a meter
3. Adjust with pH Up or pH Down
4. Water the plant
5. Measure runoff pH (should be in range)

## EC Control (Electrical Conductivity)

EC measures salt concentration in the solution.

| Stage | EC (mS/cm) |
|-------|------------|
| Seedling | 0.4 - 0.8 |
| Early veg | 0.8 - 1.2 |
| Late veg | 1.2 - 1.6 |
| Early bloom | 1.4 - 1.8 |
| Peak bloom | 1.6 - 2.2 |
| Ripening | 0.0 - 0.4 |

## Feeding Schedule by Stage

### Seedling (Weeks 1-2)
- Plain pH'd water only
- Optional root stimulant at 1/4 strength

### Vegetative (Weeks 3-5)
- Base nutrients (Grow): start at 1/4 strength
- Gradually increase to full strength
- Add CalMag as needed (especially with coco)

### Flowering (Weeks 6-10)
- Switch to bloom nutrients
- Add PK booster mid-flower
- Lower leaf yellowing is normal

### Flush (Final 1-2 Weeks)
- Plain pH'd water only
- Flushes remaining salts for cleaner taste

## Common Mistakes

1. **Overwatering** — roots rot without oxygen
2. **Overfeeding** — leaf tips burn
3. **Ignoring pH** — nutrient lockout
4. **Cold water** — shocks roots (use 68-72°F / 20-22°C water)

## Growie Can Help

With the Growie app, you can:
- Set up watering schedule with reminders
- Log pH and EC for every feeding
- Track nutrient consumption
- Get recommendations based on growth stage
