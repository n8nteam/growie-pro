# Nutrient Deficiencies and Toxicities

![Nutrient Deficiencies](/images/guides/deficiencies.jpg)

Leaves are your plant's health indicator. Their color, shape, and condition tell you which element is lacking or in excess. This guide will help you quickly diagnose problems.

## The Golden Rule of Diagnosis

Before treating a deficiency, check:

1. **Solution and medium pH** — 90% of problems are pH-related
2. **Solution EC** — is it too concentrated?
3. **Watering** — overwatering or underwatering?
4. **Temperature** — stress can mask deficiencies

> If pH is out of range — all elements are locked out, even if they're present in the medium. Fix pH first!

## Quick Diagnosis: Where Do Symptoms Appear?

### Symptoms on Lower (Older) Leaves

These are **mobile** elements — the plant pulls them from old leaves:

| Symptom | Likely Deficiency |
|---------|------------------|
| Uniform yellowing from bottom | Nitrogen (N) |
| Interveinal chlorosis, veins stay green | Magnesium (Mg) |
| Leaf edges burn and dry out | Potassium (K) |
| Purple stems and petioles | Phosphorus (P) |

### Symptoms on Upper (New) Leaves

These are **immobile** elements — the plant can't redistribute them:

| Symptom | Likely Deficiency |
|---------|------------------|
| Bright interveinal chlorosis on top | Iron (Fe) |
| Deformed new leaves | Calcium (Ca) |
| Small yellow spots on young leaves | Manganese (Mn) |
| Small, curled leaves | Zinc (Zn) |
| Growing tips die off | Boron (B) |
| Uniform yellowing from top | Sulfur (S) |

## Detailed Breakdown of Each Deficiency

### Nitrogen Deficiency (N)

**Appearance:**
- Lower leaves turn uniformly yellow
- Yellowing progresses upward
- Leaves drop off
- Overall pale green color

**Treatment:**
- Increase Grow nutrient dose
- Feed with urea (fast effect)
- Check pH (6.0-6.5 for soil)

### Phosphorus Deficiency (P)

**Appearance:**
- Stems and petioles turn purple
- Dark green leaves with bronze tint
- Lower leaves curl and die
- Slow growth and poor flowering

**Treatment:**
- Increase Bloom nutrient dose
- Check pH (phosphorus locks out at pH &gt;7 and &lt;5.5)
- Ensure root zone temperature &gt;64°F / 18°C

### Potassium Deficiency (K)

**Appearance:**
- Leaf edges and tips yellow, then turn brown
- Burn spreads inward on the leaf
- Leaves become brittle and crispy
- Weak stems

**Treatment:**
- Increase potassium dose
- Monopotassium phosphate is a good option
- Check for excess sodium

### Calcium Deficiency (Ca)

**Appearance:**
- New leaves deformed, curled, with uneven edges
- Brown spots on young leaves
- Growing tips die off
- Roots brown and fragile

**Treatment:**
- Add CalMag
- Check pH (calcium locks out at pH &lt;6.0)
- Ensure no potassium excess (competes with Ca)

### Magnesium Deficiency (Mg)

**Appearance:**
- Classic interveinal chlorosis — veins green, tissue yellow
- Starts on lower and middle leaves
- Tips may curl upward
- Later — brown spots

**Treatment:**
- Add CalMag or Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate) — 1 g/L
- Check pH
- Always use CalMag on coco

### Iron Deficiency (Fe)

**Appearance:**
- Bright interveinal chlorosis at the top
- New leaves nearly white with green veins
- The most distinctive and recognizable deficiency

**Treatment:**
- Lower pH (iron locks out at pH &gt;6.5)
- Use chelated iron (Fe-DTPA or Fe-EDDHA)
- Don't confuse with magnesium deficiency (Fe — top, Mg — bottom)

## Toxicities (Excess)

### General Signs of Overfeeding

- Leaf tips burn (dark brown or yellow)
- Leaves are dark green and glossy
- "Clawing" — leaves curl downward
- Stunted growth despite healthy appearance

### Nitrogen Toxicity

- Dark green, "clawed" leaves
- Delayed flowering
- Loose, bland buds
- **Solution:** flush, reduce dose

### Phosphorus Toxicity

- Locks out zinc, iron, calcium
- Interveinal chlorosis (secondary deficiency)
- **Solution:** flush, reduce PK

### Potassium Toxicity

- Locks out calcium and magnesium
- Salt buildup in medium
- **Solution:** flush with plain water

### Nutrient Burn

- Yellow or brown leaf tips
- Sharp line between healthy and damaged tissue
- **Solution:** flush with 3x pot volume of water, reduce EC

## Troubleshooting Algorithm

```
1. Photograph the problem
2. Determine — symptoms on top or bottom?
3. Measure solution and runoff pH
4. Measure runoff EC
5. If pH is off → correct pH
6. If EC is high → flush
7. If pH and EC are normal → add the missing element
8. Wait 3-5 days to evaluate results
9. Damaged leaves WON'T recover — watch new growth
```

## Nutrient Lockout

Often the problem isn't a missing element but a locked-out one:

- **High pH** → locks out iron, manganese, zinc, boron
- **Low pH** → locks out calcium, magnesium, phosphorus
- **Excess of one element** → blocks another (antagonism)
- **Salt buildup** → general lockout

## Practical Tips

1. **Don't panic** — a single yellow leaf isn't a problem
2. **Take photos** — track changes day by day
3. **Start with pH** — this solves most issues
4. **Don't change everything at once** — adjust one parameter at a time
5. **New growth** is the success indicator — old leaves won't recover
