# Compost Tea and Homemade Fertilizers

![Compost Tea](/images/guides/compost-tea.jpg)

Homemade fertilizers are a great way to supplement your plant's nutrition with natural ingredients. Let's explore the most effective recipes and how to apply them properly.

## Compost Tea (AACT)

Actively Aerated Compost Tea (AACT) is a concentrate of beneficial microorganisms produced by aerating compost in water.

### Why Use Compost Tea

- Populates the medium with beneficial bacteria and fungi
- Strengthens plant immunity
- Improves soil structure
- Increases nutrient availability
- Suppresses pathogenic organisms

### What You'll Need

- 3-5 gallon bucket
- Aquarium air pump with airstone
- Quality compost or worm castings (vermicompost)
- Dechlorinated water
- Unsulfured molasses — 1 tablespoon per 3 gallons
- Mesh bag (old stocking works)

### Recipe

1. **Fill the bucket** with dechlorinated water (let tap water sit 24h or use filtered)
2. **Place compost** (2-3 cups) in the mesh bag
3. **Submerge the bag** in water
4. **Add molasses** — this feeds the bacteria
5. **Turn on aeration** — the pump must run continuously
6. **Brew for 24-48 hours** at 65-75°F / 18-24°C
7. **Tea is ready** when it has a mild earthy smell

### How to Use

- Use **immediately after brewing** — bacteria start dying after 4-6 hours
- Dilute 1:5 with water for root drench
- For foliar spray — strain and dilute 1:10
- Apply once every 1-2 weeks
- Don't use during flush

### What to Avoid

- Don't use chlorinated water — chlorine kills bacteria
- Don't brew longer than 48 hours — anaerobic process starts (foul smell)
- If the tea smells rotten — dump it and start over
- Don't store — bacteria die quickly without aeration

## Banana Peel Infusion

Rich in potassium — excellent supplement during flowering.

### Recipe

1. Collect peels from 3-4 bananas
2. Chop finely
3. Cover with 1 quart of water
4. Steep for 3-5 days (refrigerator OK)
5. Strain
6. Dilute 1:5 with water

### Content and Use

- **Potassium** — primary element
- **Phosphorus** — small amount
- **Magnesium** — trace amounts
- Use once every 1-2 weeks during flowering

## Wood Ash Solution

Wood ash is a source of potassium, calcium, and micronutrients.

### Recipe

1. Take 1 cup of wood ash (not coal ash!)
2. Add to 3 gallons of water
3. Stir and steep for 24 hours
4. Strain through cheesecloth
5. Use without further dilution

### Content

- **Potassium** (K₂O) — 3-8%
- **Calcium** (CaO) — 20-35%
- **Magnesium** — 2-5%
- **Micronutrients** — boron, manganese, iron

### Cautions

- Ash **raises pH** — use carefully
- Don't mix with ammonium-based fertilizers
- Don't use ash from chemically treated wood
- Ideal for acidic substrates

## Nettle Infusion

Rich in nitrogen — suitable for vegetative stage.

### Recipe

1. Collect fresh nettles (without seeds)
2. Fill a bucket 1/3 full
3. Cover with water
4. Steep for 7-14 days, stirring daily
5. Strain
6. Dilute 1:10 with water

### Notes

- Strong odor — steep outdoors
- Rich in nitrogen, iron, and silicon
- Strengthens plant immunity
- Don't use during flowering (too much N)

## Molasses

Simple and effective food for soil microbiome.

### How to Use

- **Dosage**: 1-2 ml per liter of water
- **When**: once a week from veg through the last 2 weeks
- **Why**: feeds beneficial bacteria in soil

### Benefits

- Contains sugars, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron
- Stimulates microbial activity
- Improves harvest taste and aroma
- Cheap and accessible

## Eggshell Calcium

A source of calcium.

### Recipe

1. Rinse and dry eggshells
2. Grind into powder (blender or mortar)
3. Add 1 tablespoon per liter of water
4. Add a few drops of vinegar (dissolves calcium)
5. Steep for 24 hours
6. Strain and use

### Notes
- Slow calcium release
- Can also add powder directly to medium
- Slightly raises pH

## Homemade Fertilizer Reference Table

| Fertilizer | Primary Element | Stage | Frequency |
|-----------|----------------|-------|-----------|
| Compost tea | Microbiome | Any | 1-2 weeks |
| Banana peel | Potassium (K) | Flowering | 1-2 weeks |
| Wood ash | Potassium + Calcium | Flowering | 2-3 weeks |
| Nettle | Nitrogen (N) | Vegetative | 1-2 weeks |
| Molasses | Sugars + K | Any | 1 week |
| Eggshell | Calcium (Ca) | Any | 2-3 weeks |

## Important Rules

1. **Homemade fertilizers supplement**, not replace, base nutrition
2. **Don't overdo it** — even organics can harm in excess
3. **Check pH** after adding homemade solutions
4. **Don't use in hydroponics** — they clog systems
5. **Compost tea works best** in living soil
6. **Always strain** solutions before watering
