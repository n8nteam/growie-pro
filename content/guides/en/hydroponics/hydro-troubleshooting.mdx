# Common Problems and Solutions

Every hydroponic grower encounters problems. The difference between a novice and an experienced grower is not the absence of problems but the speed and accuracy of diagnosis. Hydroponic systems provide tremendous control, but they also lack the natural buffering of soil — problems develop faster and escalate more quickly. This guide is a comprehensive troubleshooting reference organized by symptom category, covering nutrient deficiencies, solution chemistry issues, root problems, biological threats, and equipment failures.

## Nutrient Deficiencies

Nutrient deficiencies are among the most common issues in hydroponics. They manifest as visible changes in leaf color, shape, and growth pattern. In most cases, the deficiency is not caused by a lack of the nutrient in the solution but rather by pH being outside the optimal range, preventing uptake.

**Before diagnosing a deficiency, always check pH first.** If pH is outside the 5.5-6.5 range, correct it and wait 48-72 hours before concluding that a nutrient is actually absent from the solution.

### Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

- **Symptoms:** Uniform yellowing (chlorosis) of lower/older leaves, progressing upward. Leaves may eventually drop. Overall growth is stunted. Stems may become thin and spindly.
- **Cause:** Insufficient nitrogen in the solution, or very low EC. Can also occur when pH is too high (above 7.0).
- **Solution:** Increase overall nutrient concentration (raise EC by 0.2-0.4 mS/cm). Verify pH is in the 5.5-6.5 range. If using a multi-part nutrient, ensure the nitrogen-heavy component (usually "Grow" or "Part A") is dosed correctly.

### Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

- **Symptoms:** Dark green leaves that develop purple or reddish-purple discoloration, particularly on stems and leaf undersides. Older leaves may show necrotic (dead) spots. Root growth slows.
- **Cause:** Often caused by cold root zone temperature (below 16 degrees Celsius), which inhibits phosphorus uptake even when P is present in solution. Also occurs at pH above 7.0 or below 5.0.
- **Solution:** Raise root zone temperature to 18-22 degrees Celsius. Check and correct pH. If temperature and pH are correct, increase phosphorus in the nutrient formula.

### Potassium (K) Deficiency

- **Symptoms:** Brown scorching and curling of leaf edges (marginal necrosis), starting on older leaves. Leaves may appear dull and develop interveinal chlorosis.
- **Cause:** Insufficient potassium in the solution. High sodium levels can compete with potassium uptake. High calcium can also antagonize K.
- **Solution:** Increase potassium supplementation (potassium sulfate or potassium silicate). Ensure source water does not have excessive sodium. Check that calcium levels are not disproportionately high.

### Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

- **Symptoms:** Distorted, curled, or cupped new growth. Leaf tips and edges of young leaves turn brown and crispy. In fruiting crops, blossom end rot (dark, sunken spots on the bottom of fruit). Root tips may become stunted.
- **Cause:** Low calcium in solution, pH too low (below 5.0) or too high (above 6.5), poor transpiration conditions (very high humidity reduces calcium transport to growing tips), or excessive potassium/magnesium competing with calcium uptake.
- **Solution:** Add calcium (calcium nitrate is the standard source). Correct pH. Improve air circulation to promote transpiration. Avoid excessive potassium or magnesium supplementation.

### Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

- **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves — the tissue between veins turns yellow while veins remain green, creating a characteristic striped or mottled pattern. In severe cases, leaves develop necrotic spots and curl upward.
- **Cause:** Insufficient magnesium in the solution. Excessive potassium or calcium can compete with Mg uptake. pH below 5.0 reduces availability.
- **Solution:** Add Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate) at 1-2 grams per liter. Ensure potassium and calcium are not excessively high. Correct pH if needed.

### Iron (Fe) Deficiency

- **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on new/young leaves (distinct from magnesium, which affects old leaves). New growth emerges pale yellow or almost white, with green veins. In severe cases, leaves become entirely bleached.
- **Cause:** pH above 6.5 is the most common cause — iron becomes insoluble at high pH even when present in the solution. Can also result from insufficient iron in the formula or poor chelation.
- **Solution:** Lower pH to 5.5-6.0. Use chelated iron (Fe-DTPA is stable at pH up to 7.0; Fe-EDDHA is stable even higher). Ensure the nutrient formula includes adequate chelated iron.

### Quick Reference: Deficiency Diagnosis

| Nutrient | Affected Leaves | Key Symptom | Most Common Cause |
|---|---|---|---|
| Nitrogen | Old (lower) | Uniform yellowing | Low EC |
| Phosphorus | Old (lower) | Purple discoloration | Cold roots or high pH |
| Potassium | Old (lower) | Brown leaf edges | Low K in solution |
| Calcium | New (upper) | Curled, crispy tips | High humidity, low Ca |
| Magnesium | Old (lower) | Interveinal chlorosis | Low Mg, high K |
| Iron | New (upper) | Interveinal chlorosis, bleaching | pH too high |

## pH Problems

### pH Swings (Rapid Fluctuation)

- **Symptoms:** pH changes by more than 0.5 units between checks (12-24 hours). Plant may show mixed deficiency symptoms.
- **Causes:**
  - Small reservoir volume (less than 20 liters for mature plants). Less water means less buffering capacity.
  - Algae growth causing pH to rise during light periods and fall during dark periods.
  - Decomposing organic matter in the system.
  - Weak or exhausted nutrient solution.
- **Solutions:** Increase reservoir volume. Eliminate algae by blocking light. Clean the system. Change nutrient solution more frequently. Use a more concentrated nutrient formula to increase buffering.

### pH Continuously Drifts Upward

- **Symptom:** pH steadily rises from target (5.8) toward 7.0 or higher over 24-48 hours.
- **Causes:** Plants actively consuming nutrients (particularly nitrogen in nitrate form) release hydroxide ions, raising pH. This is normal in a healthy, actively growing system.
- **Solution:** This is expected behavior. Adjust pH down regularly, or install an automated pH dosing system. Do not overshoot — lower pH gradually.

### pH Continuously Drifts Downward

- **Symptom:** pH drops from target toward 4.0 or lower.
- **Causes:** Ammonium-based nitrogen sources release hydrogen ions as they are absorbed, lowering pH. Decomposing organic matter produces acids. Root rot can also cause acidification.
- **Solution:** Check for root rot. Switch to nitrate-based nitrogen sources. Remove decomposing organic matter. If using organic nutrients, expect more pH instability and adjust accordingly.

## EC Problems

### EC Rises Over Time

- **Symptom:** EC increases between reservoir changes.
- **Cause:** Plants are consuming more water than nutrients (common in hot, dry conditions with high transpiration rates). Water evaporates, concentrating the remaining nutrients.
- **Solution:** Top off with plain water (not nutrient solution) to bring EC back to target. If EC consistently rises, reduce the base nutrient concentration slightly.

### EC Drops Over Time

- **Symptom:** EC decreases between reservoir changes.
- **Cause:** Plants are consuming nutrients faster than water. This is common in cooler conditions with lower transpiration, or with heavy-feeding plants in flowering.
- **Solution:** Top off with nutrient solution at a slightly higher concentration than the target. If EC consistently drops, raise the base nutrient concentration.

### EC Unstable (Erratic Readings)

- **Symptom:** EC readings are inconsistent or jump around.
- **Cause:** Poorly mixed solution, malfunctioning EC probe, or temperature fluctuations affecting readings (EC is temperature-dependent).
- **Solution:** Ensure thorough mixing. Calibrate or replace the EC probe. Use a temperature-compensating EC meter.

## Root Problems

### Brown Roots (Not Rot)

- **Symptom:** Roots are stained brown but are firm, not mushy, and have no foul odor.
- **Cause:** Many organic nutrients and some synthetic ones (especially those containing humic acid or certain chelates) stain roots brown. This is cosmetic, not pathogenic.
- **Solution:** No action needed if roots are firm and healthy-smelling. Differentiate from root rot by touch and smell.

### Slimy Root Surface

- **Symptom:** Roots feel slimy or slippery but are not necessarily brown.
- **Cause:** Biofilm buildup from bacteria (not necessarily pathogenic). Can precede root rot if conditions deteriorate.
- **Solution:** Improve aeration. If running sterile, dose H2O2 or HOCl. If running living, add beneficial microbes and enzymes. Monitor temperature.

### Slow Root Growth

- **Symptom:** New roots develop slowly or not at all after transplanting.
- **Cause:** Cold root zone, very high EC (osmotic stress), pH extremes, or transplant shock.
- **Solution:** Ensure root temperature is 18-22 degrees Celsius. Reduce EC to 0.8-1.2 mS/cm for newly transplanted plants. Correct pH. Provide mild conditions for the first week after transplant.

## Algae

### Green Algae on Surfaces

- **Symptom:** Green growth on reservoir walls, growing media, net pots, or the nutrient solution surface.
- **Cause:** Light reaching surfaces in contact with nutrient solution. Algae require only light and nutrients to grow — both abundant in hydroponics.
- **Effects:** Algae consume oxygen and nutrients, die and decompose (feeding pathogens), clog emitters and filters, and cause pH fluctuations.
- **Solution:** Block all light from the reservoir and root zone. Use opaque materials for all components. Clean affected surfaces. H2O2 (3 mL/L of 3%) or HOCl will kill existing algae.

## Equipment Failures

### Pump Failure

- **Symptom:** No water flow. Plants wilt rapidly in systems where roots are not continuously submerged (drip, NFT, aeroponic).
- **Causes:** Power failure, pump burnout, clogged impeller, disconnected tubing.
- **Prevention:** Use a backup pump. Install a power-failure alarm. Clean pump intakes regularly. Use inline filters to prevent debris from reaching the pump.
- **Emergency response:** In drip or NFT systems, manually water plants immediately while diagnosing the pump issue. In DWC, the air pump is more critical — ensure aeration continues even if the recirculation pump fails.

### Air Pump Failure

- **Symptom:** No bubbles in the reservoir. In DWC, dissolved oxygen drops rapidly, and root rot risk increases dramatically.
- **Prevention:** Keep a spare air pump on hand. Use air pumps with high-quality diaphragms. Some growers run two smaller air pumps instead of one large one for redundancy.
- **Emergency response:** Manually agitate the solution surface to introduce some oxygen. Replace or repair the air pump immediately.

### Salt Buildup

- **Symptom:** White crystalline deposits on growing media surfaces, net pots, reservoir walls, and drip emitters. Emitters may clog, causing uneven watering.
- **Cause:** Mineral salts precipitate as water evaporates. More common in hard water areas and in systems with frequent dry cycles.
- **Solution:** Flush growing media with plain pH-adjusted water weekly. Clean drip emitters with a dilute acid solution (citric acid or vinegar). Use inline filters. Reduce EC if salt buildup is severe.

### Slow Growth (General)

- **Symptom:** Plants are alive but growing much slower than expected, with no specific deficiency symptoms visible.
- **Causes (in order of likelihood):**
  1. Insufficient light — the most common cause of slow growth in indoor hydroponics.
  2. Temperature too low (air or root zone).
  3. EC too low (underfeeding) or too high (osmotic stress).
  4. pH outside optimal range (nutrient lockout).
  5. Root problems not yet visible.
  6. Genetics — some cultivars simply grow slowly.
- **Solution:** Evaluate each factor systematically. Increase light intensity or duration. Check both air and root temperature. Verify EC and pH. Inspect roots. Compare against known growth rates for the cultivar.

## Systematic Troubleshooting Process

When something goes wrong, resist the urge to change multiple variables at once. Follow this process:

1. **Observe** — Document the symptoms precisely. What leaves are affected? Old or new? What color? What pattern?
2. **Measure** — Check pH, EC, temperature (air and solution), and dissolved oxygen if possible.
3. **Inspect** — Look at the roots. Smell the solution. Check all equipment.
4. **Hypothesize** — Based on observations and measurements, identify the most likely cause.
5. **Correct one variable** — Make a single change to address the most probable cause.
6. **Wait** — Give the plant 48-72 hours to respond. Do not make additional changes during this time.
7. **Reassess** — If symptoms improve, you found the cause. If not, move to the next most likely hypothesis.

This disciplined approach prevents the common beginner mistake of chasing symptoms, where multiple simultaneous changes create new problems that mask the original issue.
