# The Kratky Method (Passive Hydroponics)

The Kratky method is the simplest form of hydroponics in existence. It requires no pumps, no air stones, no electricity, and no timers. A plant sits in a container of nutrient solution, and as the plant drinks the solution, an air gap develops between the water surface and the net pot. Roots in this air gap absorb oxygen, while roots still submerged in the solution absorb water and nutrients. It is a truly passive system that works remarkably well for many crops, particularly leafy greens and herbs.

## Who Is B.A. Kratky?

The method is named after Bernard A. Kratky, a researcher at the University of Hawaii who published a series of papers beginning in 2009 describing a non-circulating hydroponic technique. Kratky's research demonstrated that plants could be grown successfully in static nutrient solutions without any aeration equipment, provided that the container was sized appropriately for the crop and the initial nutrient concentration was sufficient to sustain the plant through its entire growth cycle.

Kratky did not invent the concept of passive water culture, which has historical roots in various experimental settings, but he formalized the method, defined the parameters for success, and published extensively on optimizing it for practical food production. His work made the technique accessible to home growers and small-scale farmers worldwide.

## The Declining Water Level Principle

Understanding the core principle of the Kratky method is essential for success. Here is how the process unfolds:

1. **Initial setup:** A net pot containing the plant and growing medium sits in a lid on top of a container. The nutrient solution level is high enough to touch the bottom of the net pot, wetting the growing medium and the emerging roots.

2. **Early growth:** The plant begins absorbing solution. Roots grow downward into the liquid, and the water level begins to drop slowly.

3. **Air gap formation:** As the water level falls, an expanding zone of moist air develops between the solution surface and the net pot. Roots in this zone are exposed to air and develop differently from submerged roots. These air roots become the primary pathway for oxygen absorption.

4. **Continued growth:** The plant now has two distinct root zones: submerged roots that absorb water and nutrients, and air roots that absorb oxygen. This dual-zone arrangement replaces the need for an air pump entirely.

5. **Harvest:** Ideally, the plant is harvested around the time the nutrient solution is nearly depleted. The container size, starting volume, and nutrient concentration are chosen so that the solution lasts approximately as long as the crop's growing cycle.

The critical insight is that you must not refill the container to its original level once the air gap has formed. Doing so would drown the air roots, which are not adapted to submersion, and can kill the plant. If you must add solution, add only enough to maintain the submerged root zone without flooding the air roots.

## Setting Up a Kratky System

The setup is almost absurdly simple compared to other hydroponic methods.

### Materials Needed

- An opaque container (mason jar wrapped in tape, storage tote, or bucket)
- A net pot sized to fit the container opening
- Growing medium (clay pebbles, perlite, or vermiculite)
- Hydroponic nutrient solution
- pH testing kit and adjustment solutions
- A seedling or cutting

### Assembly Steps

1. **Prepare the container.** Ensure it is opaque to prevent algae growth. If using glass mason jars, wrap them completely in aluminum foil, duct tape, or paint them. Light is the enemy of a Kratky system because algae will compete with the plant for nutrients and oxygen.

2. **Cut or fit the net pot.** If using a mason jar, a 3-inch net pot often fits directly into a wide-mouth jar opening. For storage totes, cut holes in the lid just as you would for a DWC system.

3. **Mix the nutrient solution.** Fill the container with water and add hydroponic nutrients according to the manufacturer's directions. For leafy greens, a moderate concentration (EC of 1.0 to 1.6 mS/cm) works well. Adjust pH to the 5.5 to 6.5 range.

4. **Set the water level.** The solution should touch the bottom of the net pot or come within half an inch of it. The growing medium in the net pot should wick up enough moisture to keep the seedling's roots wet.

5. **Place the seedling.** Insert the seedling into the net pot with growing medium surrounding the stem and roots. If roots are short, ensure they dangle through the net pot holes and reach the solution or are close enough that wicking action keeps them moist.

6. **Place in a lit area.** Position the container under grow lights or in a sunny window. That is it. There is nothing to plug in, no timers to set, and no pumps to monitor.

## Best Plants for the Kratky Method

The Kratky method excels with crops that have moderate water requirements and relatively short growing cycles:

- **Lettuce** — The ideal Kratky crop. Compact root system, short growing cycle, moderate nutrient demands. A single quart-sized mason jar can produce a full head of lettuce.
- **Herbs (basil, cilantro, mint, parsley)** — Grow quickly and do well in small containers.
- **Kale and Swiss chard** — Slightly more demanding but still excellent Kratky candidates in 1- to 3-gallon containers.
- **Spinach** — Fast-growing and well-suited to passive hydroponic culture.
- **Green onions** — Almost foolproof in Kratky systems.
- **Peppers** — Possible in larger containers (5 gallons or more) but require nutrient top-ups during the long growing season.
- **Tomatoes (small varieties)** — Can be grown in Kratky using very large containers (10 gallons or more), though they push the limits of the passive approach.

As a general rule, the larger and longer-lived the plant, the larger the container must be, and the more likely you will need to intervene with nutrient top-ups. The Kratky method is at its best with fast, compact crops grown to a single harvest.

## Container Sizing Guidelines

Matching the container volume to the crop is one of the most important decisions in Kratky growing:

| Crop | Minimum Container Size |
|------|----------------------|
| Lettuce, small herbs | 1 quart (1 liter) |
| Large herbs, kale | 1 to 3 gallons |
| Peppers, small tomatoes | 5 gallons |
| Large tomatoes, cucumbers | 10+ gallons |

Undersized containers run out of nutrients before the plant matures. Oversized containers waste nutrients but are otherwise not harmful. When in doubt, go larger.

## Limitations of the Kratky Method

While the simplicity of Kratky is its greatest strength, it also imposes real limitations:

### No Oxygen Boost
Without an air pump, the dissolved oxygen in the solution is limited. High water temperatures (above 75 degrees Fahrenheit) reduce dissolved oxygen further, increasing the risk of root problems. The Kratky method works best in moderate temperature environments.

### Single Crop Cycle
The system is designed for one crop cycle per fill. After harvesting, you empty the container, clean it, and start fresh. This makes it less suitable for long-lived perennial crops or situations where continuous production is needed without interruption.

### Limited Scalability
Managing dozens of individual Kratky containers, each with its own nutrient solution and pH, becomes tedious. For larger operations, active systems like RDWC or NFT are more practical.

### Nutrient Depletion
As the plant consumes the solution, nutrient ratios shift because plants absorb different elements at different rates. In a short crop cycle like lettuce, this rarely becomes a problem. In a long cycle like tomatoes, it can lead to deficiencies that require intervention.

### No Error Recovery
If something goes wrong — wrong pH at the start, too much or too little nutrient concentration, algae contamination — there is no circulating system to help buffer or correct the problem. Prevention is the only reliable strategy in Kratky growing.

## Tips for Success

- **Start with lettuce.** It is forgiving, fast, and provides quick gratification.
- **Use opaque containers every time.** Even brief light exposure encourages algae.
- **Do not refill to the original level.** Respect the air gap once it has formed.
- **Mix nutrients accurately.** You only get one chance per cycle to get the starting concentration right.
- **Check pH at the start and leave it alone.** Unlike active systems, there is no practical way to adjust pH mid-cycle without disturbing the roots.
- **Grow in moderate temperatures.** Between 65 and 78 degrees Fahrenheit is ideal for both the solution and the growing environment.
- **Use multiple small containers** rather than one large one for leafy greens. This lets you stagger plantings and harvest continuously.

## Conclusion

The Kratky method proves that hydroponics does not need to be complicated or expensive. With nothing more than a container, some nutrients, and a seedling, you can produce fresh greens and herbs without any electrical equipment whatsoever. It is the perfect introduction to soilless growing for beginners, apartment dwellers, or anyone who wants to experiment with hydroponics at the lowest possible cost and complexity. While it has genuine limitations for larger or longer-lived crops, within its sweet spot of leafy greens and herbs, the Kratky method is remarkably effective and deeply satisfying.
