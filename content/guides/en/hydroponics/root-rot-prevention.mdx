# Root Rot: Prevention and Treatment

Root rot is the single most common and destructive disease in hydroponic systems. It has ended more grows, frustrated more beginners, and cost more money than any other hydroponic problem. The good news is that root rot is almost entirely preventable with proper management, and even established infections can sometimes be treated if caught early. This guide covers everything you need to know about identifying, preventing, and treating root rot in your hydroponic system.

## What Is Root Rot?

Root rot in hydroponics is primarily caused by **Pythium**, a genus of oomycetes (water molds) that thrive in aquatic environments. Despite being commonly called a fungus, Pythium is technically not a true fungus — it belongs to a separate kingdom of organisms more closely related to brown algae. This distinction matters because some antifungal treatments effective against true fungi have limited impact on Pythium.

Other organisms that can cause or contribute to root rot include:

- **Phytophthora** — A close relative of Pythium with similar behavior.
- **Fusarium** — A true fungus that causes root and crown rot in some crops.
- **Anaerobic bacteria** — In severely oxygen-depleted systems, anaerobic bacteria can cause root decay even without Pythium.

In practice, most hydroponic root rot is Pythium-driven, and the management strategies for all these organisms overlap significantly.

## Recognizing the Symptoms

Early detection is critical. Root rot progresses rapidly, and the window for successful treatment narrows with each day.

### Early Symptoms

- **Subtle wilting** — Plants wilt slightly during the hottest part of the day, then recover at night. This is easy to dismiss but is often the first sign.
- **Slowed growth** — Growth rate decreases without an obvious cause.
- **Root discoloration** — Healthy roots are bright white. The earliest sign of Pythium is a slight tan or cream discoloration, usually starting at the root tips.
- **Slightly off smell** — Healthy hydroponic root zones smell faintly of minerals or have no odor. A faint sour or musty smell is an early warning.

### Moderate Symptoms

- **Persistent wilting** — Plants no longer fully recover overnight.
- **Yellowing lower leaves** — As root function declines, lower (older) leaves yellow and may drop. This mimics nitrogen deficiency.
- **Brown, mushy roots** — The outer layer (cortex) of affected roots becomes soft and brown. When gently pulled, the cortex may slide off, revealing the inner stele (vascular strand) as a thin white string.
- **Distinct unpleasant odor** — The nutrient solution smells sour, swampy, or rotten.

### Severe Symptoms

- **Widespread brown, slimy root mass** — The entire root system is discolored and gelatinous.
- **Severe wilting and leaf curling** — The plant can no longer uptake water.
- **Nutrient lockout** — Even with adequate EC, the plant shows multiple deficiency symptoms.
- **Plant death** — In severe cases, the plant collapses entirely within days of visible root symptoms.

## What Causes Root Rot

Root rot is rarely caused by a single factor. It is almost always the result of conditions that favor pathogen growth while simultaneously weakening plant defenses.

### High Nutrient Solution Temperature

This is the number one risk factor. When solution temperature exceeds 24 degrees Celsius (75 degrees Fahrenheit), two things happen simultaneously: dissolved oxygen drops, and Pythium growth rate increases. Above 28 degrees Celsius, conditions become nearly ideal for rapid Pythium proliferation.

### Low Dissolved Oxygen

Roots are aerobic organs. They require oxygen for respiration, nutrient uptake, and maintaining cell wall integrity. When dissolved oxygen drops below 5 mg/L, root cells become stressed and vulnerable. Pythium, which can function in low-oxygen conditions, exploits this weakness.

### Light Exposure to Roots or Solution

Light penetrating the reservoir or root zone promotes algae growth. Algae compete with roots for oxygen and nutrients, and their decomposition creates organic matter that feeds Pythium. Light also directly damages exposed root tissue.

Common light leak points:

- Translucent reservoir walls
- Gaps around net pots in DWC lids
- Uncovered rockwool or growing media surfaces
- Clear or light-colored tubing

### Dead Organic Matter

Decaying roots, dead leaves that fall into the reservoir, and decomposing organic nutrient residues all provide food for Pythium. A clean system with minimal organic debris is significantly more resistant.

### Stagnant Zones

Areas of the system where water moves slowly or not at all develop localized oxygen depletion. These become breeding grounds for anaerobic bacteria and Pythium.

### Contamination Sources

Pythium can enter a system through:

- Contaminated growing media
- Unsterilized tools and containers
- Infected transplants from other grows
- Dust and soil particles
- Unfiltered outdoor air in some environments

## Prevention Strategies

Prevention is always more effective than treatment. A well-designed and properly maintained system rarely develops root rot.

### Temperature Control

Keep nutrient solution between 18 and 22 degrees Celsius. This single measure eliminates the majority of root rot risk. Use a water chiller if necessary, insulate reservoirs, and keep them away from heat sources.

### Aeration

Provide vigorous aeration with properly sized air pumps and air stones. As a rough guideline, provide at least 1 liter per minute of air per 4 liters of nutrient solution. More is better — you virtually cannot over-aerate a hydroponic system.

### Light Exclusion

- Use opaque reservoirs. If using plastic totes, choose dark-colored ones or wrap them in opaque material.
- Seal all gaps around net pots with neoprene inserts or foam collars.
- Cover exposed growing media surfaces with opaque material.
- Use opaque tubing throughout the system.

### Cleanliness

- Remove dead leaves and plant debris from the reservoir immediately.
- Clean and sterilize the entire system between crops using hydrogen peroxide, bleach solution, or commercial cleaners.
- Wash hands and sterilize tools before working in the root zone.
- Never reuse growing media without thorough sterilization.

### Reservoir Management

- Change the nutrient solution completely every 7-14 days rather than just topping off indefinitely.
- Monitor pH and EC regularly — instability can indicate biological problems.
- Size the reservoir appropriately. Larger volumes are more stable and resist temperature swings.

### Choose the Right Approach

Either a sterile system (using H2O2 or HOCl) or a living system (with beneficial microbes) provides protection against Pythium. A system that is neither sterile nor biologically active — that is simply neglected — has the highest risk.

## Treatment Methods

If root rot has been identified, immediate action is required. The specific treatment depends on the severity and your overall system approach.

### Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2)

Hydrogen peroxide is the most widely used emergency treatment for root rot.

**Protocol:**

1. Remove the plant from the system.
2. Trim away all visibly brown, mushy root material with sterilized scissors. Cut back to clean, white tissue.
3. Prepare a bath of 3% hydrogen peroxide at a concentration of 3 mL per liter of water.
4. Submerge the remaining roots in this bath for 10-15 minutes.
5. Drain the entire hydroponic system. Clean and sterilize the reservoir and all components.
6. Refill with fresh nutrient solution.
7. Add H2O2 to the fresh reservoir at 1-2 mL per liter (of 3% solution) as a maintenance dose.
8. Return the plant to the system.
9. Continue H2O2 maintenance doses every 2-3 days until new white root growth is established.

**Important notes:** H2O2 decomposes into water and oxygen, so it must be reapplied. It will kill beneficial microbes as well as pathogens, so do not combine with biological products. Food-grade H2O2 (3% or 35% diluted) is preferred over pharmacy-grade, which may contain stabilizers.

### Hypochlorous Acid (HOCl)

Hypochlorous acid is increasingly popular as a root rot treatment and preventative. It is more stable than H2O2 and effective at lower concentrations.

**Protocol:**

1. Follow the same root trimming and system cleaning steps as above.
2. Use a product like UC Roots or Athena Cleanse according to label directions, typically achieving 1-2 ppm free chlorine in the nutrient solution.
3. Maintain this concentration continuously.

HOCl is compatible with mineral salt nutrients and does not significantly affect pH at these concentrations. It is not compatible with organic nutrients or beneficial microbes.

### Enzyme Treatments

Enzymatic products (Cannazym, Hygrozyme, SLF-100) contain cellulase, pectinase, and other enzymes that break down dead root material. They do not directly kill Pythium, but they remove the organic debris that fuels pathogen growth.

Enzyme treatments work well as a complement to either H2O2/HOCl (in sterile systems) or beneficial microbes (in living systems). They are compatible with both approaches.

### Beneficial Microbe Re-Inoculation

If you are running a living system and root rot develops, it usually indicates that the beneficial microbial community has been overwhelmed. Treatment involves:

1. Trim dead roots.
2. Clean the system.
3. Refill with fresh nutrient solution.
4. Apply a heavy initial dose of beneficial microbes (Hydroguard, Great White, or similar).
5. Address the root cause — usually temperature, oxygen, or both.
6. Continue regular microbial applications.

Do not combine this with H2O2 or HOCl.

### Addressing the Root Cause

No treatment will provide lasting results if the underlying conditions are not corrected. After any root rot treatment, you must:

- Lower solution temperature to the 18-22 degrees Celsius range.
- Increase aeration.
- Eliminate light leaks.
- Improve cleanliness protocols.
- Consider whether your reservoir volume is adequate.

## Recovery Expectations

Recovery from root rot depends on severity:

| Severity | Recovery Time | Prognosis |
|---|---|---|
| Early (slight discoloration) | 5-10 days | Excellent with prompt treatment |
| Moderate (partial root loss) | 2-4 weeks | Good, but growth will be set back |
| Severe (majority root loss) | 4-8 weeks if plant survives | Fair — consider starting fresh |
| Critical (plant collapsed) | N/A | Replace the plant |

During recovery, reduce nutrient concentration to half or two-thirds of normal strength. The reduced root mass cannot handle full-strength feeding. Gradually increase concentration as new roots develop.

Maintain optimal environmental conditions — temperature, humidity, light — to support the plant's recovery. Avoid stressing recovering plants with training, pruning, or transplanting.

## Building a Root-Rot-Proof System

The ultimate goal is a system where root rot simply does not occur. This requires:

1. **Temperature control** — Non-negotiable. Invest in a chiller if needed.
2. **Generous aeration** — Oversize the air pump. It costs almost nothing to run and provides enormous protection.
3. **Complete light exclusion** — No shortcuts. Every gap is a risk.
4. **Regular cleaning** — Treat system hygiene as seriously as a surgeon treats hand hygiene.
5. **Consistent sterilization or biological protection** — Choose your approach and maintain it diligently.
6. **Monitoring** — Check roots, temperature, and solution smell regularly. Catch problems before they become emergencies.

Root rot is a solved problem in well-managed hydroponic systems. The growers who suffer from it repeatedly are almost always neglecting one or more of these fundamentals. Master them, and root rot becomes a thing of the past.
