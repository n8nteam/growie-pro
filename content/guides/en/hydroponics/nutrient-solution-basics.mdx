# Nutrient Solution Basics

The nutrient solution is the lifeblood of any hydroponic system. It replaces everything that soil would normally provide — every mineral element a plant needs to grow, flower, and fruit. Getting the solution right is not difficult once you understand what goes into it, but getting it wrong can stall growth, cause deficiencies, or even kill your plants. This article covers the essential nutrients, how commercial formulas work, how to mix them properly, and how to adjust for different growth stages.

## What Plants Need

Plants require 17 elements to complete their life cycle. Three come from air and water: carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O). The remaining 14 must be supplied in the nutrient solution. These are divided into macronutrients (needed in larger quantities) and micronutrients (needed in trace amounts).

### Macronutrients

**Primary macronutrients** — required in the largest quantities:

- **Nitrogen (N)** — drives vegetative growth, leaf production, and chlorophyll synthesis. Supplied as nitrate (NO3-) and sometimes ammonium (NH4+). Deficiency causes yellowing of older leaves and stunted growth.
- **Phosphorus (P)** — essential for root development, energy transfer (ATP), flowering, and fruiting. Supplied as phosphate (H2PO4- or HPO4 2-). Deficiency causes dark, purplish leaves and poor root growth.
- **Potassium (K)** — regulates water balance, enzyme activation, and transport of sugars. Supplied as the K+ ion. Deficiency causes brown leaf edges and weak stems.

**Secondary macronutrients** — required in moderate quantities:

- **Calcium (Ca)** — builds cell walls, stabilizes membranes, and supports root growth. Supplied as Ca2+. Deficiency causes blossom end rot in tomatoes and tip burn in lettuce.
- **Magnesium (Mg)** — the central atom in chlorophyll and a cofactor for many enzymes. Supplied as Mg2+. Deficiency causes interveinal yellowing (chlorosis) on older leaves.
- **Sulfur (S)** — a component of amino acids, proteins, and some vitamins. Supplied as sulfate (SO4 2-). Deficiency is rare in hydroponics because most nutrient salts contain sulfate.

### Micronutrients

Required in very small amounts but absolutely essential:

- **Iron (Fe)** — critical for chlorophyll synthesis and electron transport. Usually supplied in chelated form (Fe-EDTA, Fe-DTPA, or Fe-EDDHA) to prevent precipitation at higher pH values.
- **Manganese (Mn)** — involved in photosynthesis and enzyme activation.
- **Zinc (Zn)** — necessary for hormone regulation and enzyme function.
- **Copper (Cu)** — plays a role in photosynthesis and lignin synthesis.
- **Boron (B)** — essential for cell wall formation and reproductive development.
- **Molybdenum (Mo)** — required for nitrogen metabolism. Needed in the smallest amount of all micronutrients.
- **Chlorine (Cl)** — involved in photosynthesis and osmotic regulation. Usually present in sufficient quantities in tap water.
- **Nickel (Ni)** — needed in extremely small amounts for urease enzyme activity.

## Commercial Nutrient Systems

Very few hydroponic growers mix nutrient solutions from individual chemical salts. Instead, most use concentrated liquid or powder formulas manufactured by nutrient companies. These come in several formats.

### Two-Part Systems

The most common format for hobbyists. Nutrients are split into two bottles (Part A and Part B) because certain concentrated chemicals react with each other and form insoluble precipitates if stored together. Specifically, concentrated calcium and concentrated sulfates or phosphates will combine to form gypsum or calcium phosphate, which settles out of solution.

- **Part A** typically contains: calcium nitrate, iron chelate, and sometimes potassium nitrate.
- **Part B** typically contains: magnesium sulfate, monopotassium phosphate, and the remaining micronutrients.

When mixed separately into water at the working dilution, the concentrations are low enough that these reactions do not occur.

### Three-Part Systems

Some brands offer three separate bottles — typically labeled Grow, Micro, and Bloom. This gives the grower more flexibility to adjust the ratio for different growth stages:

- **Grow** — higher in nitrogen for vegetative growth.
- **Micro** — contains calcium, iron, and most micronutrients. Used at a consistent rate throughout the grow.
- **Bloom** — higher in phosphorus and potassium for flowering and fruiting.

By varying the ratios of Grow and Bloom while keeping Micro constant, you can shift the nutrient profile as your plant progresses from seedling to harvest.

### Dry (Powder) Nutrients

Some growers prefer dry nutrients for cost efficiency, especially at scale. Products like Jack's 321 (Jack's Nutrients), Masterblend, and MaxiGro/MaxiBloom from General Hydroponics are popular powder options. Dry nutrients are cheaper per liter of solution, have an indefinite shelf life, and are lighter to ship. The tradeoff is that they require a scale for accurate measurement and sometimes dissolve more slowly.

### Popular Brands

- **General Hydroponics Flora Series** — the original three-part system. Widely available and well-documented.
- **Advanced Nutrients pH Perfect** — two-part system with built-in pH buffering technology.
- **Jack's Nutrients 321** — a cost-effective two-part powder system popular with commercial and hobby growers.
- **Masterblend** — another affordable dry nutrient system using a three-component mix (Masterblend 4-18-38, calcium nitrate, and Epsom salt).
- **Canna** — Dutch brand with specialized formulas for different growing media (coco, hydro, soil).
- **Athena** — professional-grade two-part liquid or dry nutrients used in large commercial operations.

## How to Mix a Nutrient Solution

Proper mixing technique prevents chemical reactions that can lock out nutrients.

### Step-by-Step Mixing

1. **Start with water** — fill your reservoir or mixing container with the desired volume of water. If using tap water, let it sit uncovered for 24 hours to allow chlorine to off-gas (this does not remove chloramine — see the water quality article for more).

2. **Measure your water's baseline EC** — this tells you how many dissolved minerals are already present.

3. **Add Part A (or Micro)** — pour the measured amount of Part A into the water and stir thoroughly until fully dissolved. For three-part systems, always add Micro first.

4. **Stir thoroughly** — ensure Part A is fully dispersed before adding Part B.

5. **Add Part B (or Grow/Bloom)** — pour Part B into the solution and stir again. For three-part systems, add Grow and Bloom one at a time, stirring between each.

6. **Never mix concentrates directly together** — do not pour Part A concentrate into Part B concentrate. Always dilute each part into water separately.

7. **Measure EC** — check that the final EC matches your target for the current growth stage.

8. **Adjust pH** — after all nutrients are mixed, measure pH and adjust to the 5.5–6.5 range using pH Up or pH Down.

9. **Add supplements last** — if you use additional products like cal-mag, silica, or beneficial bacteria, add them after the base nutrients are mixed and pH is close to target. Note: silica (potassium silicate) should be added first, before nutrients, as it raises pH significantly and can precipitate if added to a concentrated nutrient mix.

### Example Recipe: Masterblend for Lettuce

For a 20-liter reservoir targeting EC 1.2 mS/cm:

| Component | Amount |
|---|---|
| Masterblend 4-18-38 | 12 g |
| Calcium nitrate (15.5-0-0) | 12 g |
| Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate) | 6 g |

1. Dissolve calcium nitrate in the water first. Stir.
2. Add Masterblend. Stir.
3. Add Epsom salt. Stir.
4. Check EC — should be approximately 1.2 mS/cm.
5. Adjust pH to 5.8–6.0.

This is a starting point. Adjust quantities based on your actual EC readings and plant response.

## Adjusting for Growth Stages

Plants need different nutrient ratios at different stages of development.

### Seedling/Clone Stage

Young plants have small root systems and low nutrient demand. Use a quarter to half-strength solution (EC 0.4–0.8 mS/cm). High concentrations can burn delicate roots and cause osmotic stress.

### Vegetative Stage

During active leaf and stem growth, plants need higher nitrogen relative to phosphorus and potassium. Increase solution strength to EC 1.0–1.8 mS/cm. If using a three-part system, use a higher proportion of Grow relative to Bloom.

### Flowering/Fruiting Stage

As plants shift to reproductive growth, reduce nitrogen and increase phosphorus and potassium. EC can rise to 1.6–2.4 mS/cm depending on the crop. In three-part systems, reduce Grow and increase Bloom while keeping Micro constant.

### Late Stage/Ripening

Some growers reduce EC in the final week or two before harvest (EC 1.0–1.4 mS/cm) to encourage the plant to use stored nutrients and improve flavor. This practice, sometimes called "flushing," is debated, but many growers find it beneficial for taste and quality.

## Reservoir Management

### Topping Off vs Full Change

As plants drink from the reservoir, the water level drops and the nutrient concentration shifts. Between full solution changes:

- **Top off with plain water** when the level drops and EC is at or above target.
- **Top off with dilute nutrient solution** when EC has dropped below target.

Perform a full reservoir change every 7 to 14 days for most systems. This prevents the accumulation of unused ions, organic compounds exuded by roots, and potential pathogens.

### Temperature

Keep the nutrient solution between 18 and 22 degrees Celsius (65 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit). Cold solutions slow nutrient uptake. Warm solutions hold less dissolved oxygen and promote pathogen growth. If your reservoir temperature is hard to control, consider a water chiller for warm environments or an aquarium heater for cold ones.

### Light Protection

Always keep reservoirs covered and opaque. Light penetration promotes algae growth, which competes for oxygen and nutrients, clogs lines and emitters, and can harbor pathogens.

## Recognizing Nutrient Problems

Even with a well-mixed solution, problems can arise. Common signs:

- **Yellowing older leaves** — likely nitrogen deficiency. Increase overall nutrient strength or add a nitrogen supplement.
- **Purplish stems and dark leaves** — possible phosphorus deficiency. Check pH — phosphorus locks out above pH 7.0.
- **Brown leaf edges** — potassium deficiency or salt burn from excessive EC. Check EC and adjust.
- **Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves** — magnesium deficiency. Add Epsom salt (1–2 g per liter).
- **Interveinal chlorosis on newer leaves** — iron deficiency. Check pH — iron locks out above pH 6.5. Add chelated iron if needed.
- **Tip burn on lettuce** — usually calcium deficiency caused by poor transpiration (low airflow, high humidity) rather than insufficient calcium in solution.

Always check pH and EC before diagnosing a nutrient deficiency. What looks like a deficiency is often a lockout caused by incorrect pH, and the fix is pH adjustment rather than adding more nutrients.

## Summary

A properly prepared and maintained nutrient solution provides everything your plants need. Start with a reputable two-part or three-part commercial formula, follow the manufacturer's mixing instructions, measure EC and pH after mixing, and adjust for growth stage. Monitor the reservoir daily, top off as needed, and perform full changes regularly. With these habits, your nutrient solution will support healthy, productive plants from seedling to harvest.
