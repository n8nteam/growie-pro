# EC, PPM, TDS — Measuring Solution Concentration

Knowing your pH tells you whether nutrients are available. Knowing your EC tells you whether nutrients are present in the right amount. Electrical conductivity, parts per million, and total dissolved solids are three ways of expressing the same fundamental measurement: how concentrated your nutrient solution is. Understanding these values, how to measure them, and what targets to aim for is essential for consistent hydroponic results.

## What Is EC?

EC stands for Electrical Conductivity, measured in milliSiemens per centimeter (mS/cm) or microSiemens per centimeter (uS/cm). Pure water conducts almost no electricity. When you dissolve mineral salts — the nutrient ions your plants consume — the water becomes conductive. The more dissolved ions, the higher the conductivity.

An EC meter works by passing a small electrical current between two electrodes immersed in the solution and measuring how easily the current flows. Higher EC means more dissolved salts, which generally means a stronger nutrient solution.

EC is the most universal and precise measurement because it reads the actual physical property of the solution without any conversion factor applied. When hydroponic professionals and nutrient manufacturers discuss solution strength, they typically use EC.

Key reference points:

- Pure distilled water: 0.0 mS/cm
- Typical tap water: 0.2–0.8 mS/cm
- RO (reverse osmosis) water: 0.0–0.05 mS/cm
- Seedling nutrient solution: 0.4–0.8 mS/cm
- Vegetative growth: 1.0–1.8 mS/cm
- Flowering/fruiting: 1.6–2.4 mS/cm
- Maximum for most crops: 2.5–3.0 mS/cm

## What Are PPM and TDS?

PPM stands for Parts Per Million — the number of milligrams of dissolved solids per liter of water (mg/L). TDS stands for Total Dissolved Solids and is essentially the same concept expressed as a measurement.

Here is the complication: EC meters measure conductivity, not dissolved solids directly. To display a PPM or TDS reading, the meter must apply a conversion factor to convert the EC value into an estimated PPM. Unfortunately, the industry has never agreed on a single conversion factor.

### The Two Common Conversion Scales

**Scale 500 (NaCl scale):**
PPM = EC (in mS/cm) x 500

This scale is based on a sodium chloride reference solution. It is used by Hanna Instruments, most American nutrient manufacturers, and many affordable meters sold in the United States.

**Scale 700 (KCl / 442 scale):**
PPM = EC (in mS/cm) x 700

This scale is based on a potassium chloride reference solution and is used by Eutech, Truncheon, and some European and Australian manufacturers and meters.

### Why This Matters

A nutrient solution with an EC of 2.0 mS/cm reads as:
- **1000 PPM** on the 500 scale
- **1400 PPM** on the 700 scale

These are huge differences that can lead to serious errors if you follow a feeding chart calibrated for one scale while your meter uses the other. You mix what you think is a 1000 PPM solution but it is actually 1400 PPM by the chart's standard, and you burn your plants.

### The Solution: Know Your Scale — Or Just Use EC

The simplest way to avoid confusion is to work in EC (mS/cm). EC is EC regardless of the meter brand. If a nutrient manufacturer recommends EC 1.6, every meter on the planet will read approximately 1.6 mS/cm for that solution.

If your meter only reads PPM, determine which conversion factor it uses. Check the manual or the manufacturer's website. If you cannot determine the scale, you can test it: mix a solution with a known EC (using a calibrated EC meter) and see what PPM your TDS meter displays. Divide the PPM reading by the EC value, and you will get approximately 500 or 700.

## Using Your EC/TDS Meter

### Choosing a Meter

Budget EC/TDS meters are available for $10 to $30 and are adequate for hobbyists. They typically display either EC or PPM (some toggle between both). Mid-range meters ($40 to $80) offer better accuracy, automatic temperature compensation (ATC), and longer probe life. Professional meters with replaceable probes and data logging cost $100 and up.

Look for these features:

- **Automatic Temperature Compensation (ATC)** — conductivity changes with temperature, so ATC adjusts the reading to a standard reference temperature (usually 25 degrees Celsius). Without ATC, you must manually correct readings based on solution temperature.
- **Selectable conversion factor** — some meters let you choose between 500 and 700 scale, or display raw EC.
- **Calibration capability** — the ability to calibrate with a standard reference solution for ongoing accuracy.

### Calibration

EC meters should be calibrated regularly using a reference solution of known conductivity. Common calibration standards are 1.413 mS/cm and 2.764 mS/cm. The procedure is similar to pH meter calibration:

1. Rinse the probe with distilled water.
2. Immerse in calibration solution.
3. Adjust the meter to match the reference value.
4. Rinse and store properly.

Calibrate at least monthly for hobby use, or weekly for commercial operations.

### Measuring Technique

1. Collect a sample of nutrient solution from the reservoir — not from the surface, where concentration can differ due to evaporation.
2. Ensure the sample is near the reference temperature (25 degrees Celsius) or use a meter with ATC.
3. Immerse the probe fully and wait for the reading to stabilize (10 to 30 seconds).
4. Record the value.
5. Rinse the probe with distilled water after each use.

## Optimal EC Values by Growth Stage

Different growth stages have different nutrient demands. Seedlings and young clones are sensitive to high salt concentrations, while mature fruiting plants need stronger solutions.

### General Guidelines

| Growth Stage | EC (mS/cm) | PPM (500 scale) | PPM (700 scale) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Seedlings/clones | 0.4–0.8 | 200–400 | 280–560 |
| Early vegetative | 0.8–1.2 | 400–600 | 560–840 |
| Full vegetative | 1.2–1.8 | 600–900 | 840–1260 |
| Transition | 1.4–2.0 | 700–1000 | 980–1400 |
| Flowering/fruiting | 1.6–2.4 | 800–1200 | 1120–1680 |
| Late flowering/ripening | 1.0–1.6 | 500–800 | 700–1120 |

These are general ranges. Specific crops may prefer higher or lower values:

- **Lettuce and herbs** — prefer lower EC, typically 0.8–1.4 mS/cm. Higher concentrations cause tip burn.
- **Tomatoes** — tolerate higher EC, often 2.0–3.0 mS/cm during fruiting. Some growers push EC higher to intensify flavor at the expense of yield.
- **Strawberries** — moderate EC, around 1.0–1.6 mS/cm.
- **Peppers** — moderate to high, 1.4–2.4 mS/cm.

## Understanding EC in Practice

### Baseline Water EC

Before mixing nutrients, measure your source water EC. Tap water typically reads 0.2–0.8 mS/cm depending on mineral content. RO water reads near 0.0. When calculating your target EC, account for the baseline.

For example, if your tap water is 0.4 mS/cm and your target is 1.6 mS/cm, you need to add nutrients equivalent to 1.2 mS/cm of EC increase, not 1.6.

### Adjusting Concentration

**EC too high:**
- Add plain water (RO or distilled is best) to dilute the solution.
- If persistently high, reduce the amount of nutrient concentrate in your next batch.

**EC too low:**
- Add more nutrient concentrate to the reservoir.
- If persistently low, increase the concentration in your next mix.

**EC rising over time in the reservoir:**
This means the plant is drinking more water than it is absorbing nutrients. The remaining solution becomes more concentrated. Top off with plain water to bring EC back to target.

**EC dropping over time in the reservoir:**
The plant is absorbing nutrients faster than water. The solution is becoming diluted. Add a small amount of nutrient concentrate to restore the target.

### The Relationship Between EC and pH

EC and pH interact. As plants absorb specific ions, both the concentration and the ionic balance of the solution change, which affects pH. High EC can suppress nutrient uptake and cause pH instability. Low EC can lead to rapid pH swings because there are fewer ions in solution to buffer changes.

Maintaining EC within the recommended range helps stabilize pH and ensures consistent nutrient availability.

## Common Mistakes

- **Ignoring source water EC** — mixing nutrients without accounting for the minerals already in your tap water can result in EC overshoot.
- **Confusing PPM scales** — following a feeding chart designed for the 500 scale with a meter that uses the 700 scale (or vice versa) leads to over- or under-feeding.
- **Not calibrating** — EC meters drift over time. An uncalibrated meter may read significantly off.
- **Measuring at extreme temperatures** — without ATC, hot or cold solutions give inaccurate readings. Measure at or near 25 degrees Celsius.
- **Only checking EC, not pH** — EC and pH must be managed together. A perfect EC means nothing if pH is outside the availability range.
- **Overreacting to small changes** — EC will naturally fluctuate slightly between feedings. Adjust only when values drift significantly outside your target range.

## Practical Workflow

A reliable daily monitoring routine:

1. Check reservoir water level — top off with plain water if needed.
2. Stir or circulate the solution.
3. Measure EC. If outside target range, adjust with water (to lower) or nutrients (to raise).
4. Measure pH. Adjust if outside 5.5–6.5 range.
5. Record values in a log (a simple notebook or spreadsheet works).

This five-minute daily routine catches problems early and keeps your nutrient solution in the zone where plants thrive. Over time, patterns in your log will teach you how quickly your specific plants, system, and environment shift EC and pH, allowing you to anticipate and prevent issues before they affect growth.
