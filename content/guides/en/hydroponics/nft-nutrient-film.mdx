# NFT — Nutrient Film Technique

The Nutrient Film Technique, universally known as NFT, is a hydroponic method in which a thin, shallow stream of nutrient solution flows continuously over plant roots inside gently sloped channels. Only the bottom portion of the root mass contacts the flowing solution, while the upper portion remains exposed to the humid air inside the channel. This creates an excellent balance between nutrient delivery and root oxygenation. NFT has become one of the most widely used commercial hydroponic systems, particularly for lettuce and leafy greens production, and it adapts well to home-scale setups with some care.

## The Thin Film Principle

The defining characteristic of NFT is the thin film of nutrient solution — typically only 1 to 3 millimeters deep — that flows along the bottom of each channel. This film is deep enough to supply water and dissolved nutrients to the roots but shallow enough that the majority of the root mass sits above the waterline in a highly oxygenated, humid environment.

The thin film is maintained by careful control of three factors:

1. **Flow rate:** The pump delivers a low, steady volume of solution to the top of each channel.
2. **Channel slope:** A slight downward gradient ensures the solution flows smoothly from the inlet end to the drain end without pooling.
3. **Channel profile:** Flat-bottomed channels with low sidewalls allow the solution to spread into a wide, shallow film rather than collecting in a deep stream.

When these three factors are properly calibrated, the solution moves gently over the roots, delivering nutrients and maintaining moisture without waterlogging. The thin film also means that any interruption in flow — such as a pump failure — can be dangerous, as roots begin to dry within minutes.

## Essential Components

A complete NFT system includes the following elements:

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| Growing channels | House the plants and direct the nutrient film |
| Reservoir | Stores the nutrient solution |
| Submersible pump | Circulates solution from the reservoir to the channels |
| Supply tubing | Delivers solution from the pump to the channel inlets |
| Return drain | Carries spent solution from the channel outlets back to the reservoir |
| Net pots or planting cups | Hold plants in the channel openings |
| Channel end caps | Seal the upper ends of the channels |
| Timer (optional) | Some growers run the pump intermittently, though continuous flow is standard |
| Support frame | Maintains the correct channel slope |

Growing channels are typically made from PVC pipe (round or square profile), purpose-built NFT channels with flat bottoms and lids, or even standard rain gutters. Commercial NFT channels are designed with a flat bottom profile that promotes an even film, and they include pre-cut holes for net pots at regular spacing.

## Channel Slope and Dimensions

Getting the slope right is one of the most important aspects of NFT system design.

### Recommended Slope

The standard recommendation is a slope of 1:30 to 1:40, meaning the channel drops 1 inch for every 30 to 40 inches of horizontal length. For a 4-foot (48-inch) channel, this translates to a drop of approximately 1.2 to 1.6 inches from inlet to drain.

A slope that is too steep causes the solution to flow too quickly, reducing contact time with the roots. A slope that is too gentle allows the solution to pool, creating waterlogged zones that reduce oxygen availability.

### Channel Length

Commercial NFT channels are typically 3 to 12 meters (10 to 40 feet) long. For home systems, channels of 4 to 8 feet work well and are easier to manage. Longer channels risk nutrient depletion toward the drain end, as plants upstream consume nutrients first.

### Channel Width

Standard NFT channels are 3 to 6 inches wide. Wider channels are used for larger plants like tomatoes, while narrower channels suit lettuce and herbs. The channel must be wide enough to prevent roots from completely damming the flow, which would create pooling upstream and starvation downstream.

## Flow Rate

The optimal flow rate for NFT channels is generally 1 to 2 liters per minute per channel (approximately 0.25 to 0.5 gallons per minute). This rate maintains the characteristic thin film without creating excessive turbulence.

When sizing your pump, calculate the total flow needed:

**Total flow = Flow per channel x Number of channels**

For a system with six channels at 1.5 liters per minute each, you need a pump capable of delivering at least 9 liters (2.4 gallons) per minute at the required head height. Always choose a pump with some excess capacity, as output decreases with increased head height.

## Advantages of NFT

NFT offers several distinct benefits that have driven its widespread commercial adoption:

- **Excellent oxygenation:** The exposed upper root zone provides abundant oxygen without the need for air pumps or air stones.
- **Water efficiency:** The closed-loop recirculating design uses significantly less water than soil cultivation. Evaporation losses are minimal because the channels are enclosed.
- **No growing medium required:** In a pure NFT system, plants are held in net pots without any substrate (or with only a small starter cube). This eliminates the cost and disposal issues associated with growing media.
- **Easy root inspection:** Lifting a channel lid reveals the entire root system, making it simple to spot problems early.
- **Scalable:** Adding more channels to an existing system is straightforward. Commercial operations routinely run hundreds of channels from a single reservoir.
- **Clean and hygienic:** Without soil or loose growing media, NFT systems are easier to sanitize between crop cycles.

## Disadvantages and Risks

NFT is not without its challenges, and some of them are significant:

- **Pump dependency:** If the pump fails, the thin film stops, and roots begin drying almost immediately. In hot conditions, plants can wilt within 20 to 30 minutes. A backup pump or alarm system is essential for serious operations.
- **Clogging risk:** Roots can overgrow and block the channel, disrupting flow. Regular inspection and pruning of excessive root growth is necessary.
- **Not ideal for all crops:** Plants with very large root systems (like mature tomato plants) can overwhelm standard channels. Larger plants require wider channels and higher flow rates.
- **Temperature sensitivity:** The thin film has almost no thermal mass, so it quickly reaches ambient temperature. In hot environments, solution temperature can spike, reducing dissolved oxygen.
- **Nutrient gradient:** Plants at the inlet end of a long channel receive fresher solution than plants at the drain end. This can cause uneven growth in long channels with many plants.

## Commercial Use

NFT is one of the dominant systems in commercial hydroponic production globally, particularly for:

- **Lettuce and leafy greens:** The most common commercial NFT crop. Channels with lettuce can produce multiple crop cycles per year.
- **Herbs:** Basil, cilantro, and other culinary herbs grow efficiently in NFT channels.
- **Strawberries:** Some commercial operations use modified NFT systems for strawberry production.
- **Tomatoes and cucumbers:** Larger NFT systems with wide channels and high flow rates are used for vine crops, though these require more engineering than leafy green systems.

The economics of commercial NFT are compelling: high plant density, rapid crop turnover, minimal water use, and labor-efficient harvesting. Many of the packaged hydroponic lettuces sold in grocery stores were grown in NFT systems.

## Building a DIY NFT System

A functional home-scale NFT system can be built from readily available materials:

### Materials

- PVC fence posts or 4-inch PVC pipe (for channels)
- PVC end caps
- 2-inch net pots
- Submersible pump (200 to 400 GPH)
- 1/2-inch vinyl tubing for supply lines
- A storage tote or bucket for the reservoir
- PVC fittings (elbows, tees) for drain plumbing
- A drill with hole saw for net pot holes
- Silicone sealant

### Assembly Overview

1. **Build the channels.** Cut PVC posts or pipes to the desired length (4 to 6 feet is manageable). Drill evenly spaced holes along the top for net pots, typically 6 to 8 inches apart for lettuce or 12 inches for larger plants.
2. **Cap the inlet end** of each channel and drill a small hole for the supply tubing to enter.
3. **Leave the drain end open** or fit it with a 90-degree elbow directing flow downward into the return drain.
4. **Mount the channels** on a frame at the correct slope (approximately 1 inch of drop per 3 feet of length).
5. **Connect supply tubing** from the pump to each channel inlet. Use tee fittings to split the supply line to multiple channels.
6. **Route the drain** from each channel back to the reservoir.
7. **Fill the reservoir** with nutrient solution, adjust pH, and start the pump.
8. **Verify flow** through every channel. Adjust the supply valves or tubing to equalize flow rates.

### Testing

Run the system for 24 hours without plants. Confirm that:

- Flow is consistent in all channels.
- No leaks exist at joints, end caps, or net pot holes.
- The pump maintains adequate flow at the required head height.
- Solution returns cleanly to the reservoir.

## Maintenance

- **Daily:** Check pump operation, visually inspect flow in each channel, measure pH and EC in the reservoir.
- **Weekly:** Inspect channels for root overgrowth that might impede flow. Clean pump intake screen.
- **Every 1 to 2 weeks:** Replace the nutrient solution entirely. Flush channels with clean water before refilling.
- **Between crop cycles:** Disassemble channels and clean thoroughly with a mild hydrogen peroxide or bleach solution. Rinse well before replanting.

## Conclusion

NFT remains one of the most elegant and efficient hydroponic methods available. Its thin-film approach delivers an outstanding balance of nutrient delivery and root oxygenation, resulting in rapid, healthy growth for a wide range of crops. While the system demands respect for its pump dependency and requires attention to flow rates and channel design, the rewards in growth speed, water efficiency, and scalability make NFT a compelling choice for both home enthusiasts and commercial growers.
