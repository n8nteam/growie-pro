# Wick System

The wick system is the simplest of all hydroponic methods. It uses no pumps, no electricity, and no moving parts. A fabric or rope wick connects a reservoir of nutrient solution to the growing medium above, transporting liquid upward through capillary action. Plants absorb water and nutrients from the moistened medium at their own pace. While the wick system has real limitations that make it unsuitable for high-demand crops, it remains an excellent entry point for beginners and a practical solution for low-maintenance growing of herbs and small leafy greens.

## Capillary Action: The Driving Principle

Capillary action is the physical phenomenon that powers every wick system. It describes the ability of a liquid to flow through narrow spaces against the force of gravity, driven by the adhesive forces between the liquid molecules and the surfaces of the material they contact.

In a wick system, the wick material contains countless tiny channels and fibers. Water molecules are attracted to these surfaces and climb upward through them, pulling more water behind them in a continuous chain. The process requires no external energy — it happens passively and constantly, as long as the wick remains in contact with the solution and the growing medium above.

The rate of capillary transport depends on several factors:

- **Wick material:** Materials with more and finer fibers transport water faster.
- **Wick thickness and number:** Thicker wicks or multiple wicks deliver more solution per unit of time.
- **Height:** Capillary action weakens with distance. The taller the gap between the reservoir surface and the growing medium, the less solution reaches the plants.
- **Solution properties:** Nutrient solutions with surfactants or wetting agents travel through wicks more easily than plain water.

## Wick Materials

The choice of wick material is one of the most important decisions in building a wick system. Common options include:

### Cotton Rope

Cotton is highly absorbent and wicks water effectively over moderate distances. Braided cotton rope in 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch diameter is the most popular choice. However, cotton is an organic material and can decompose over time, especially when constantly wet. It may also develop mold or bacterial growth in the submerged portion.

### Nylon Rope

Nylon wicks water reasonably well and resists decomposition far better than cotton. It is more durable and lasts longer in a hydroponic environment. Braided nylon is preferred over twisted nylon because the braided structure provides more capillary channels.

### Felt Strips

Strips cut from polyester or acrylic felt make excellent wicks. They are flat, which provides a large surface area for capillary transport, and synthetic felt resists biological degradation. Strips about 1 inch wide and several layers thick work well.

### Polyester or Microfiber Cord

These synthetic materials combine good wicking ability with durability. They are available in various diameters and resist rot and mold.

### Materials to Avoid

- **Polypropylene:** Does not wick water effectively.
- **Single-strand monofilament:** No capillary channels.
- **Natural jute or hemp:** Decompose rapidly in wet conditions.

## Setting Up a Wick System

### Materials Needed

- Two containers (one for the reservoir, one for the growing medium) or a single two-part container
- Wick material (2 to 4 wicks per plant)
- Growing medium
- Hydroponic nutrient solution
- pH testing and adjustment kit

### Assembly Steps

1. **Prepare the wicks.** Cut your chosen wick material to a length that reaches from the bottom of the reservoir up through the growing container. Pre-wet the wicks by soaking them in water for at least 30 minutes. Dry wicks often resist initial wetting and may not begin transporting solution reliably.

2. **Set up the reservoir.** The lower container holds the nutrient solution. It should be opaque to prevent algae and large enough to supply the plant for at least several days between refills.

3. **Thread the wicks.** Pass the wicks through holes in the bottom of the upper growing container so they dangle into the reservoir below. Spread them out within the growing container so moisture is distributed evenly across the root zone. For a single plant in a 6-inch pot, use 2 to 4 wicks.

4. **Add growing medium.** Fill the upper container with a moisture-retentive growing medium, burying the top portions of the wicks throughout the medium.

5. **Fill the reservoir.** Add nutrient solution mixed to the manufacturer's recommendations. Adjust pH to the 5.5 to 6.5 range.

6. **Plant.** Place your seedling or cutting in the growing medium. Water the medium from the top once to establish initial moisture contact with the wicks.

7. **Place under light.** Position the system under grow lights or in a sunny location.

## Substrate Selection

The growing medium in a wick system should strike a balance between moisture retention and aeration. Because the wick delivers solution slowly and continuously, the medium must hold enough moisture to keep roots hydrated but not so much that it becomes waterlogged and suffocates them.

### Recommended Substrates

| Substrate | Suitability | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Perlite/vermiculite mix (50/50) | Excellent | The classic wick system medium. Good retention and drainage. |
| Coco coir | Good | Retains moisture well, provides decent aeration. |
| Vermiculite alone | Acceptable | High retention but poor aeration. Risk of waterlogging. |
| Perlite alone | Poor | Drains too fast for slow wick delivery. |
| Clay pebbles | Poor | Far too fast-draining for wick-based delivery. |

The perlite and vermiculite blend is the most commonly recommended medium for wick systems because it provides the ideal balance of capillary connectivity, moisture retention, and air space.

## Limitations

The wick system's simplicity comes with significant limitations that every grower should understand:

### Low Delivery Rate

Capillary action is inherently slow. The amount of solution a wick can transport per hour is limited, and it decreases as the height between the reservoir surface and the root zone increases. This means the wick system cannot keep up with the water demands of large, fast-growing, or fruiting plants.

### Not Suitable for Large Plants

Tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, and other large or fruiting crops transpire far more water than wicks can deliver. These plants will become chronically water-stressed in a wick system, resulting in poor growth and low yields.

### Nutrient Concentration Issues

As water evaporates from the growing medium and is transpired by the plant, the nutrient salts left behind can accumulate in the medium over time. This gradual concentration buildup can reach toxic levels if not addressed. Periodic flushing of the growing medium with plain water helps prevent salt accumulation.

### Wick Degradation

Organic wick materials decompose. Even synthetic wicks can develop biofilm or mineral deposits that reduce their wicking efficiency over time. Wicks should be inspected and replaced periodically.

### Height Limitation

Capillary action becomes increasingly weak with height. For most wick materials, effective wicking height is limited to about 6 to 10 inches. Systems that position the growing medium much higher than this above the reservoir surface will suffer from inadequate solution delivery.

## Best Use Cases

Given its limitations, the wick system excels in specific situations:

- **Herbs on a windowsill:** Basil, parsley, mint, and similar small herbs thrive in wick systems and do not demand rapid water delivery.
- **Small lettuce and greens:** Compact lettuce varieties, spinach, and microgreens grow well with passive wicking.
- **Educational projects:** The simplicity of the wick system makes it ideal for classroom demonstrations and teaching the basics of hydroponics.
- **Vacation watering:** A wick system can keep houseplants hydrated during extended absences, functioning as a low-tech self-watering pot.
- **Seed starting:** Wick-based setups provide gentle, consistent moisture for germinating seeds and nurturing young seedlings.
- **Low-maintenance growing:** For growers who want fresh herbs without daily attention, wick systems require only periodic reservoir refills.

## Optimization Tips

While the wick system will never match the performance of active hydroponic methods, several strategies can improve its effectiveness:

- **Use multiple wicks.** Three or four wicks per plant deliver more solution than a single wick. Spread them across the bottom of the container.
- **Keep the reservoir full.** As the reservoir level drops, the wicking distance increases and delivery slows. Refill regularly to maintain a short wicking distance.
- **Choose the right medium.** The perlite/vermiculite blend outperforms most other options in wick systems.
- **Pre-wet everything.** Dry wicks and dry growing medium resist initial wetting. Saturate both before assembly.
- **Flush monthly.** Water the growing medium from the top with plain pH-adjusted water to wash out accumulated salts, then resume normal wicking.
- **Minimize height.** Keep the vertical distance between the reservoir surface and the growing medium as short as possible.

## Comparison with Other Passive Methods

The wick system is sometimes compared to the Kratky method, which is also passive and requires no electricity. The key difference is that Kratky submerges roots directly in the nutrient solution, while the wick system delivers solution to the roots indirectly through a growing medium. Kratky generally produces faster growth because roots have direct, unrestricted access to the solution, but the wick system offers the advantage of a more familiar soil-like environment that some growers prefer.

## Conclusion

The wick system proves that hydroponic growing does not require complexity or expense. With nothing more than a wick, a container, and some nutrient solution, you can grow fresh herbs and small greens with virtually zero technical knowledge and zero ongoing energy costs. While it cannot compete with active systems for large or demanding crops, the wick system occupies a valuable niche as the most accessible and maintenance-free hydroponic method available. For anyone curious about growing plants without soil, it is a perfect place to begin.
